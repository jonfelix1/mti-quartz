# Structural Modeling Objects

## Classes
- **Templates** for instances of people, places, or things.

## Attributes
- **Properties** that describe the state of an instance of a class (an object).

## Operations
- **Actions** or functions that a class can perform.

## Relationships
- Describe how classes relate to one another.
- Three basic types in UML:
  - **Generalization**:
    - Enables inheritance of attributes and operations.
    - Represents relationships that are “**a-kind-of**”.
  - **Aggregation**:
    - Relates parts to wholes or assemblies.
    - Represents relationships that are “**a-part-of**” or “has-parts”.
  - **Association**:
    - Miscellaneous relationships between classes.
    - Usually a weaker form of aggregation.

## Object Identification
- **Textual analysis** of use-case information:
  - Nouns suggest classes.
  - Verbs suggest operations.
- Creates a rough first cut to provide an **object list**.
- **Brainstorming**: People offering ideas.
- An initial list of classes (objects) is developed.
- Attributes, operations, and relationships to other classes can be assigned in a second round.

### Common Object Lists
- Physical things
- Incidents
- Roles
- Interactions
- Patterns:
  - Useful groupings of collaborating classes that provide solutions to common problems (are reusable).
  - Developed patterns provide a starting point for work in similar domains.
