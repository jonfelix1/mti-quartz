## Overview

- **Definition**: Object diagrams are a snapshot of the instances of classes at a particular moment, showing how objects are interconnected and the values of their attributes.

## Key Features

- **Instantiation**:
    - Represents classes with actual instances. For example, instead of a generic Doctor class, you would have an instance like Dr. Smith.
- **Attributes**:
    - Each object displays its attribute values, providing a concrete view of the data contained within the class instances.

## Purpose

- **Discovery**:
    - Used to identify additional attributes, relationships, and operations that may be missing or misplaced within the class structure.
- **Validation**:
    - Helps validate the class design by showing how instances relate and interact with each other in a real-world context.

## Usage

- **Illustration**:
    - Object diagrams illustrate specific scenarios or states within the system, making it easier to understand the relationships and behaviors among instances.
- **Modeling Complex Relationships**:
    - Effective for visualizing complex interactions and dependencies between objects.
