# Throwaway Prototyping

## Definition
Developing a model to **understand** requirements better, then **discarding** it before building the final system.

### Throwaway Prototyping:
  - **Requirement Clarification**: When the main goal is to understand and clarify vague or incomplete system requirements.
  - **Risk Reduction**: When there is a need to reduce risks by testing concepts before investing in full development.
  - **Temporary Models**: When you need to explore different design options without committing to a specific approach for the final system.
