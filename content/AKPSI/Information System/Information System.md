## Information System

[[Information]] and [[[System]]

**Purpose**: **to manage information**

An **information system (IS)** is **attached** to an organization.

An **IS** is present when there is a **problem** in an organization.


- **Information:** [[Information]]  
    Definition and understanding of information in the context of data and knowledge.
    
- **System:** [[System]]  
    Overview of systems as integrated sets of components working together to achieve specific goals.
    
- **System Analyst:** [[System Analyst]]  
    Role and responsibilities of a system analyst in the development and management of information systems.
    
- **Information System:** [[Information System]]  
    Exploration of information systems, including their components, types, and functions.
    
- **Information System Methodology:** [[Information System Methodology]]  
    Discussion of methodologies used for designing and implementing information systems.
    
- **Information System Prototype:** [[Information System Prototype]]  
    Insights into the use of prototypes in developing and refining information systems.
    
- **Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC):** [[Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)]]  
    Overview of the SDLC phases and processes involved in developing information systems.


## What is Information System

- Is **IS** a **science** or not?
- **IS** has many **reference disciplines**.
- **IS** is perceived as **weak on theory**.
- **IS** is perceived as **practice-dominated**.
- **IS** employs various **research methodologies**, **models**, or **frameworks**.

### Research on Information Systems

- The “**IS**” Parts include:
    
    - **People**
    - **Objects**
    - **Procedures**
    - **Organization**
- Focus areas:
    
    - **Types of information systems** to develop.
    - **Methodologies** used.

### Some Research Questions in IS

- Why does the **problem** exist?
- What are the **business requirements** to optimize **organization performance**?
- How are these **business requirements** translated into **working modules**?
- How do these **requirements** fit into the **organization**?
- How do you **measure IS performance** in an organization?
- How do you differentiate various **approaches** to **IS development**?
