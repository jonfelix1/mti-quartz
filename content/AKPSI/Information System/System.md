## Definition
- **Definition**:
  - A **system** is a set of **detailed methods**, **procedures**, and **routines** established to carry out a specific activity, perform a duty, or solve a problem.

## Structure
  - It is an **organized, purposeful structure** consisting of **interrelated** and **interdependent elements** (e.g., components, entities, factors, members, parts). These elements influence one another to maintain the system's activity and existence to achieve its goals.

## Characteristics:
  - **Inputs, outputs, and feedback mechanisms**.
  - **Homeostasis**: Maintaining an internal steady-state despite external changes.
  - **Emergent Properties**: The system displays properties unique to the whole that are not possessed by individual elements.
  - **Boundaries**: Defined by the system observer, distinguishing the system from its environment.
