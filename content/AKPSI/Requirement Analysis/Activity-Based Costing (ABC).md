# Activity-Based Costing (ABC)
- **Activity-based costing** is an extension of duration analysis, where instead of analyzing time, you evaluate the **cost** of each step.
  - Steps with **high costs** are identified, and opportunities for **cost reduction** are explored.

  - **Steps**:
    1. Break down the process into **activities**.
    2. Assign **costs** to each activity based on resources, labor, and other factors.
    3. Analyze the **cost structure** and identify steps where **costs are disproportionately high**.
    4. Investigate whether these costs can be reduced by simplifying or optimizing steps.

## Benefits:
- Provides a clearer understanding of **cost drivers** within a process.
- Helps identify **high-cost** activities and offers opportunities to **reduce expenses** by optimizing processes.
