# Activity Elimination
- **Activity elimination** is a technique used to **streamline** business processes by removing **unnecessary or non-value-adding activities**.
  - In a **force-fit** exercise, each activity in the business process is examined to determine whether it is essential to achieving the desired outcomes.
  - Activities that do not contribute meaningfully to the process or outcome can be **eliminated** or combined with other activities.

  - **Steps**:
    1. List all the activities involved in the process.
    2. Evaluate each activityâ€™s contribution to the **overall goal**.
    3. Eliminate or modify activities that are **redundant**, **inefficient**, or **non-essential**.

## Benefits:
- Reduces **waste** by removing unnecessary steps.
- Streamlines the process, leading to faster execution and **lower costs**.
- Improves overall **process efficiency** by focusing only on value-adding activities.
