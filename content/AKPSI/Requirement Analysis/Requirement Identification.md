# Requirement Identification

## Strategies for Problem Analysis
Several strategies can be used to analyze problems and determine requirements effectively:
- **Root cause analysis**: Identifies the underlying cause of problems within the current system. This analysis can be done with [[Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram in Information Systems]]
- [[Duration Analysis]]: Examines the time taken for each step of a process, identifying bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
- [[Activity-Based Costing (ABC)]]: Focuses on the costs associated with specific activities within the system to uncover areas where cost savings can be achieved.
- [[Informal Benchmarking]]: Compares the system's processes and performance with industry standards or competitors.
- [[Outcome Analysis]]: Focuses on what the system needs to deliver in terms of outcomes and benefits.
- [[Technology Analysis]]: Looks at how new or existing technologies can be used to solve problems or improve system performance.
- [[Activity Elimination]]: Involves eliminating unnecessary activities or processes that do not add value.

## Techniques for Identifying Requirements
To gather requirements effectively, systems analysts use a variety of techniques:
- **Interviews**: Engaging with users, stakeholders, and subject matter experts to understand their needs and expectations.
- **Questionnaires**: Using structured forms to collect information from a large number of users or stakeholders.
- **Observation**: Watching how users interact with the current system to identify areas for improvement.
- **Joint Application Development (JAD)**: A collaborative workshop where business users and systems analysts work together to define system requirements.
- **Document analysis**: Reviewing existing documentation, such as procedure manuals, policy documents, or system guides, to extract relevant information.

## Creating a Requirements Definition
The process of creating a **requirements definition** involves multiple steps to ensure that both functional and non-functional requirements are captured accurately:
1. **Identify the applicable requirements**: Understand the types of requirements relevant to the project (functional and non-functional).
2. **Use requirements-gathering techniques**: Employ various techniques (e.g., interviews, observation) to gather detailed information.
3. **Verification and prioritization**: Collaborate with users to verify the accuracy of the requirements, make changes as needed, and prioritize them based on business needs.
4. **Monitor scope creep**: Continue this process through the **analysis workflow**, but be mindful of scope creep, which can lead to project delays and cost overruns.
5. **Future enhancements**: Requirements that address a need but fall outside the current project scope can be documented for potential future projects.
