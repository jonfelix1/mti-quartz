# Interviews in Requirements Gathering

**Interviews** are one of the most popular and direct techniques for gathering requirements. They involve asking stakeholders and users specific questions to gain insights into their needs, challenges, and expectations for a new system. The process is systematic and requires careful planning to ensure that relevant information is gathered efficiently.

## Interview Process
1. **Select interviewees**: Identify stakeholders, users, and experts to interview. Create a schedule for conducting interviews.
2. **Design interview questions**: Prepare different types of questions, including:
   - **Open-ended**: Encourages expansive answers.
   - **Closed-ended**: Focuses on specific information.
   - **Probing**: Follow-up questions to gain deeper understanding.
3. **Prepare for the interview**:
   - Choose between **structured** (fixed question order) or **unstructured** (flexible) formats.
   - Organize questions logically.
4. **Conduct the interview**:
   - Choose a **top-down** approach (start with general questions, then narrow down) or **bottom-up** (start specific and then broaden).
5. **Follow-up** after the interview: Summarize the key points and send them to the interviewee for verification.

## Types of Questions

### Closed-ended Questions (Specific, quantifiable)
- **How many telephone orders are received per day?**
- **How do customers place orders?**
- **What information is missing from the monthly sales report?**

### Open-ended Questions (Broader, allows elaboration)
- **What do you think about the current system?**
- **What are some of the problems you face on a daily basis?**
- **What are some improvements you would like to see in a new system?**

### Probing Questions (Follow-up, digging deeper)
- **Why?**
- **Can you give me an example?**
- **Can you explain that in a bit more detail?**

## Interviewing Strategies
- **High-level**: Very general, focusing on broad process improvements.
  - *Example*: **How can order processing be improved?**
  
- **Medium-level**: Moderately specific, focusing on particular issues.
  - *Example*: **How can we reduce the number of times customers return ordered items?**
  
- **Low-level**: Very specific, focusing on a detailed problem or task.
  - *Example*: **How can we reduce the number of errors in order processing (e.g., shipping the wrong products)?**

## Post-Interview Follow-Up
After completing the interview, it's crucial to summarize the key points and send them to the interviewee for **verification**. This ensures that the information gathered is accurate and that any misunderstandings can be clarified.

## Example of a Post-Interview Note

**Interview Date**: September 18, 2024  
**Interviewee**: John Doe, Sales Manager  
**Interviewer**: Jane Smith, Systems Analyst  
**Subject**: Requirements for the New Order Processing System

### Key Points Discussed:
1. **Current System Challenges**:
   - The current system often **fails to update order statuses** in real-time, causing delays in customer communication.
   - **Manual data entry** during the order process leads to frequent errors, especially in shipping details.
   - The system’s **reporting feature** lacks customization options, making it difficult to generate specific sales data needed by the management team.

2. **Desired Improvements**:
   - A **real-time order tracking system** that automatically updates order statuses and informs customers via email.
   - **Automated data validation** during order entry to minimize manual errors.
   - Enhanced **reporting features** that allow users to customize reports with different filters (e.g., by product category, customer region).

3. **Additional Insights**:
   - John suggested integrating the order system with the company’s **CRM** to allow sales teams to access customer data more efficiently.
   - He also emphasized the need for **mobile access** to the system, so that sales representatives can manage orders on the go.

### Next Steps:
- Verify the interview notes with John and ensure alignment on the key points.
- Incorporate the feedback into the initial **requirements documentation** for the new system.

This example post-interview note summarizes the key points discussed during the interview, ensuring the interviewee can validate the information before it is incorporated into the project.
