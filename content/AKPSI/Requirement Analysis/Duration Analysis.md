# Duration Analysis
- **Duration analysis** focuses on the time required to complete each **step** in a business process. It highlights steps that take up significant time compared to the overall process.
  - **Steps**:
    1. Break down the business process into **individual activities**.
    2. Measure the **time** required to complete each activity.
    3. Compare the **step time** to the **total time** of the entire process.
  
  - If large differences are found between the time taken by individual steps and the total process time, this may indicate:
    - **Bottlenecks** or inefficient steps.
    - Opportunities for **improvement** by:
      - **Integrating steps**: Merging multiple steps into one, streamlining the process.
      - **Parallel processing**: Performing certain steps simultaneously to reduce the overall time required.

## Benefits:
- Highlights **inefficiencies** in the process.
- Identifies opportunities for **optimization** by shortening or combining steps.
- Leads to **time savings** and potentially cost reductions.
