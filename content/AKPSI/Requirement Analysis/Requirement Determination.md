# Requirement Determination

The goal of **requirements determination** is to convert **high-level business requirements** (typically outlined in the **system request**) into **detailed requirements** that can be used to create models for system development.

**Collaboration** between **business** and **IT personnel** is essential in determining system requirements. Both groups bring different perspectives and expertise, ensuring the final set of requirements accurately reflects the needs of the business.

- **Requirement**: A statement describing what the system must do or a characteristic it must have. This statement will eventually evolve into a **technical description** of how the system will be implemented.

### Types of Requirements
1. **Functional requirements**: These are related to specific processes or data that the system must manage.
   - Examples include specific tasks the system must perform, such as generating reports or processing transactions.
2. **Non-functional requirements**: These relate to the **performance** or **usability** of the system.
   - Examples include speed, security, reliability, and user experience.

## Problems in Requirements Determination
Determining requirements is not always straightforward, and several challenges may arise:
- **Access to the correct users**: Analysts may not have access to key users who understand the system's needs.
- **Inadequate specifications**: Requirements may be too vague or incomplete, leading to misunderstandings during development.
- **Unknown requirements**: Some requirements may not be identified at the beginning of the project and emerge later.
- **Validation difficulties**: Verifying and validating requirements can be challenging, especially if there are conflicting viewpoints among stakeholders.
