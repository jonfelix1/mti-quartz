# Questionnaires
**Questionnaires** are tools used to gather information from individuals through a set of written questions. They can be paper-based or **electronic** (e.g., web-based forms). This method is particularly useful for collecting data from a large number of respondents and obtaining both **information** and **opinions**.

## Common Uses
- **Large-scale data collection**: Effective for gathering input from a large number of people.
- **Feedback collection**: Useful for obtaining opinions and information from both internal and external stakeholders (e.g., customers, vendors).
- **External design input**: Helpful when designing systems or products for external use, ensuring that the needs and preferences of the end-users are considered.

## Typical Response Rates
- **Paper-based**: Less than 50%.
- **Web-based**: Less than 30%.

## Questionnaire Steps

### 1. Select the Participants
- **Identify the population**: Determine the group from which you want to collect data.
- **Use representative samples**: For large populations, select a sample that accurately represents the larger group.

### 2. Designing the Questionnaire
- **Careful question selection**: Ensure questions are relevant and cover all necessary topics.
- **Remove ambiguities**: Use clear and precise language to avoid misunderstandings.

### 3. Administering the Questionnaire
- **Work to get a good response rate**: Strategies might include sending reminders or follow-ups.
- **Offer incentives**: Provide small rewards (e.g., a free pen) to encourage participation.

### 4. Questionnaire Follow-Up
- **Send results to participants**: Share findings to demonstrate the value of their input.
- **Send a thank-you**: Show appreciation to respondents for their time and effort.

## Good Questionnaire Design

- **Start with non-threatening and interesting questions**: Engage respondents from the beginning to maintain interest.
- **Group items into logically coherent sections**: Organize questions by topic to improve flow and comprehension.
- **Avoid placing important items at the very end**: Key questions should be positioned where they are more likely to be answered.
- **Do not crowd a page with too many items**: Keep questionnaires concise to prevent respondent fatigue.
- **Avoid abbreviations**: Use full terms to ensure clarity.
- **Avoid biased or suggestive items**: Frame questions neutrally to obtain unbiased responses.
- **Number questions**: Clearly number questions to help avoid confusion and errors.
- **Pretest the questionnaire**: Conduct a test run to identify and correct confusing or ambiguous questions.
- **Provide anonymity**: Ensure respondents feel comfortable sharing honest answers by keeping their responses confidential.

By adhering to these guidelines, questionnaires can effectively gather valuable information and feedback while minimizing potential issues.
