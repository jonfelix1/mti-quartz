# Informal Benchmarking
- **Informal benchmarking** involves comparing **business processes** from the organization with **similar processes** in other successful organizations.
  - This approach helps identify **best practices** and areas where the current system or processes can be improved.
  - By learning from the **successes** of other organizations, companies can adopt strategies that have already proven effective elsewhere.

## Benefits:
- Provides **insights** into industry standards and best practices.
- Helps identify **gaps** or inefficiencies in the current process by observing what competitors or leaders are doing better.
