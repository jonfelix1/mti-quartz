# Requirements Analysis

## Introduction
The **systems development process** involves transforming the **existing (as is)** system into the **proposed (to be)** system. This is done through various stages, with [[Requirement Determination]] being the most critical.

- [[Requirement Determination]] is crucial because:
  - Changes can be made easily at this stage.
  - A large percentage (over 50%) of system failures are attributed to issues with **requirements**.
  - Iterative processes such as **object-oriented IS analysis and design** are effective due to:
    - The ability to identify and implement small batches of requirements incrementally.
    - The system's evolution over time as more requirements are identified and addressed.

## Requirements Definition
The **requirements definition** document serves as a blueprint for system development. It contains a list of both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements in an outline format and may also include the **prioritization** of these requirements.

- It provides crucial information for subsequent stages of system development and is instrumental in defining the **scope** of the system.
- **Scope** is critical because it sets the boundaries for what the system
will accomplish and prevents **scope creep** (uncontrolled expansion of project requirements). This has been discussed in [[Scope Management]]


## [[Requirement Analysis]] Strategies
The process of [[Requirement Analysis]] involves understanding the current system (as-is), identifying areas for improvement, and developing a vision for the future system (to-be).

### Three Main Requirements Analysis Strategies
1. **Business Process Automation (BPA)**: Focuses on automating repetitive tasks to improve efficiency without fundamentally changing the underlying process.
2. **Business Process Improvement (BPI)**: Aims to enhance specific processes by making incremental changes that improve efficiency, performance, or quality.
3. **Business Process Reengineering (BPR)**: Involves radically redesigning business processes to achieve significant improvements in performance, cost reduction, or customer satisfaction.

### Additional Strategy: Business Process Opportunity (BPO)
Some discussions also include **Business Process Opportunity (BPO)**, where new opportunities for business transformation are identified, often driven by emerging technologies or market changes.
