# Outcome Analysis
- **Outcome analysis** focuses on understanding what the **customer** or **end user** expects as the final result of the business process.
  - The aim is to ensure that every step of the process is aligned with the **desired outcomes** and contributes toward achieving these outcomes efficiently.

  - **Questions asked** during outcome analysis:
    - What does the customer really want from the process?
    - Are current processes delivering the expected results?
    - How can processes be changed to better meet these **expectations**?

## Benefits:
- Ensures that processes are **customer-centric** and focused on delivering the expected **value**.
- Encourages organizations to focus on **results** rather than just activities, driving better alignment with business goals.
