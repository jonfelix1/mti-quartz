# Observation

**Observation** involves directly watching users and managers as they interact with the current system or perform their tasks. This technique helps validate information gathered through other methods and provides a real-world perspective on system usage and workflows.

## Key Considerations

### 1. Users/Managers May Not Remember Everything
- **Memory limitations**: Users and managers often do not recall all aspects of their daily tasks or processes.
- **Observation fills gaps**: Direct observation helps identify tasks and details that may be overlooked or forgotten during interviews or surveys.

### 2. Validity Check
- **Cross-check information**: Observation can confirm or challenge the validity of information collected through other techniques such as interviews or questionnaires.
- **Real-time insights**: Provides a clear view of actual workflows and system interactions.

### 3. Behavioral Changes
- **Observer effect**: Workers may alter their behavior when they know they are being observed.
  - **Increased caution**: Workers might become more careful in their actions.
  - **Low profile**: Observers should minimize their presence to avoid influencing worker behavior.
- **Avoid interruption**: Observers should avoid interrupting or influencing workers to get an accurate picture of normal operations.

### 4. Consider Periodic Activities
- **Capture all activities**: Ensure that observations cover not just daily tasks but also periodic activities (e.g., weekly, monthly, annually).
- **Comprehensive view**: Some processes and tasks only occur at specific intervals and may be crucial to understand the full scope of system usage.

## Benefits of Observation
- Provides an **accurate, real-time understanding** of how tasks are performed and how systems are used.
- Identifies **inefficiencies**, **bottlenecks**, and **workarounds** that may not be evident through other methods.
- Validates information from other sources, ensuring a comprehensive and accurate requirements gathering process.

By carefully planning and conducting observations, you can gain valuable insights into system use and identify areas for improvement or enhancement.
