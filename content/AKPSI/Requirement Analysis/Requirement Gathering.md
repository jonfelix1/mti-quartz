# Requirements Gathering

## Introduction
The **requirements gathering process** is critical for uncovering all necessary system requirements and building support and trust among users. Gathering complete and accurate requirements early in the process ensures that potential issues or overlooked requirements can be addressed without causing costly changes later in the project.

## Goals of Requirements Gathering
- **Uncover all requirements**: Ensuring that all **functional** and **non-functional** requirements are identified early on is crucial. Requirements discovered late in the process are typically more difficult and expensive to incorporate.
- **Build support and trust**: Involving **users** and **stakeholders** in the requirements gathering process fosters collaboration, trust, and user support for the new system.

## Techniques for Gathering Requirements
There are various techniques available for gathering requirements. The choice of technique depends on the projectâ€™s needs, stakeholders, and available resources.

### [[Interviews in Requirements Gathering]]
**Interviews** involve direct communication with stakeholders (e.g., business users, project sponsors) to gather insights about their needs and expectations.

**Advantages**:
- Allows for **in-depth discussions**.
- Offers opportunities for **clarification** and follow-up questions.

**Challenges**:
- Time-consuming.
- Requires skilled interviewers to extract relevant information.

### [[Joint Application Development (JAD)]]
**JAD** is a structured, facilitated workshop where stakeholders and system analysts collaborate to define system requirements.

**Advantages**:
- Encourages **collaboration** between business and IT teams.
- Reduces the time needed to gather requirements through **focused sessions**.

**Challenges**:
- Requires significant **scheduling** and **coordination**.
- Needs skilled facilitators to manage group dynamics.

### [[Questionnaires]]
**Questionnaires** are written surveys used to gather information from a large group of stakeholders.

**Advantages**:
- Efficient for gathering input from a **large audience**.
- Useful when dealing with **distributed teams** or **multiple locations**.

**Challenges**:
- Limited opportunities for **clarification** of responses.
- Responses may be **shallow** or **incomplete** if questions are not well-crafted.

### [[Document Analysis]]
**Document analysis** involves reviewing existing documentation such as manuals, policy guides, or system specifications to extract relevant information.

**Advantages**:
- Provides access to **historical information** and **existing systems**.
- Useful for **understanding current processes**.

**Challenges**:
- May not capture all **user needs** or **process changes**.
- Documents may be **outdated** or **incomplete**.

### [[Observation]]
**Observation** involves watching users interact with the current system to understand workflows, challenges, and system usage patterns.

**Advantages**:
- Provides **real-world insights** into how users perform tasks.
- Identifies **inefficiencies** or **workarounds** that may not be documented.

**Challenges**:
- Users may change their behavior when being observed ("**Hawthorne effect**").
- Time-consuming and requires **access to live environments**.

## Alternative Techniques
There's a few alternative techniques:
- [[User Stories, Story Cards & Task Lists]]
- [[Concept Maps]]
- [[R2FM Method]]

By choosing the appropriate **combination of techniques**, project teams can ensure that all critical requirements are gathered and understood, leading to a more successful system implementation.
