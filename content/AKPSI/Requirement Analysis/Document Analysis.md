# Document Analysis

## Overview
**Document analysis** is a technique used to gather information about the **current ("as-is") system** by reviewing existing documentation. This approach provides insights into the system's current state and helps identify areas for improvement.

## Key Aspects of Document Analysis

### 1. Review Technical Documents
- Examine **technical documentation** related to the current system, including system design documents, architecture diagrams, and specifications.
- Assess the **accuracy** and **completeness** of the technical details to understand how the system operates.

### 2. Review User Documents
- Analyze **user-facing documents** to understand how the system interacts with users and what functionality is required.
  - **Forms**: Examine data entry forms used by users to capture information.
  - **Reports**: Review generated reports to understand the outputs and data presented.
  - **Policy Manuals**: Study policy and procedure manuals to understand the guidelines and rules that govern system use.

### 3. Look for User Additions to Forms
- Identify any **modifications** or **additions** that users have made to standard forms.
- Such additions can indicate **gaps** in the system's functionality or areas where users have created workarounds to meet their needs.

### 4. Look for Unused Form Elements
- Review forms for **unused** or **redundant** elements that are not utilized by users.
- This can reveal **inefficiencies** in the design and highlight areas for potential simplification or removal of unnecessary components.

## Benefits of Document Analysis
- Provides a clear understanding of the **current system** and its usage.
- Identifies **gaps** and **inefficiencies** in the current system through the review of forms, reports, and policies.
- Helps in developing a comprehensive view of the **as-is state** before making improvements or implementing new systems.
