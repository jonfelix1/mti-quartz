# Environment & Infrastructure Management

**Environment** and **Infrastructure Management** are critical for ensuring that a project is executed smoothly and efficiently. This involves selecting the right tools and establishing standards for documentation and project management.

## Environment

### Choosing the Right Set of Tools

- **CASE Tools**:
  - **Productivity Increase**: Use Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools to enhance productivity and centralize project information in a repository.
  - **Diagrams**: Utilize diagrams to represent information more clearly and make it easier to understand.

- **Establish Standards**:
  - **Reduce Complexity**: Develop and follow standards to simplify processes and reduce complexity.

## Infrastructure

### Documenting the Project

- **Project Binder**:
  - **Deliverables**: Store all deliverables and communications in a project binder.
  - **Unified Process**: Use standardized documents from the Unified Process to maintain consistency.
  - **Timeliness**: Ensure documentation is not left until the end of the project or phase.

## Standards

### Types of Standards and Examples

- **Documentation Standards**:
  - **Example**: The date and project name should appear as a header on all documentation.

- **Coding Standards**:
  - **Example**: All code modules should include a header listing the programmer, last update date, and a brief description of the code's purpose.

- **Procedural Standards**:
  - **Example**: Report to project update meetings on Fridays at 3:30 PM. All changes to a requirements document must be approved by the project manager.

- **Specification Requirement Standards**:
  - **Example**: Include the name of the program to be created, a description of its purpose, and user interface design standards.

- **User Interface Design Standards**:
  - **Example**: The tab order of the screen will move from top left to bottom right. Accelerator keys will be provided for all updatable fields.

## Documentation

### Importance of Good Documentation

- **Timing**:
  - Documentation should be created up front to be effective. Documentation produced only at the end of a project or phase is less useful.

- **Project Binder Best Practices**:
  - **Internal Communications**: Include minutes from status meetings and other internal communications.
  - **Written Standards**: Document all written standards for reference.
  - **Letters**: Maintain correspondence with business users.
  - **Deliverables**: Include deliverables from each task to keep a comprehensive record.

Effective environment and infrastructure management, including the proper use of tools and adherence to standards, helps ensure that the project is well-documented and managed throughout its lifecycle.
