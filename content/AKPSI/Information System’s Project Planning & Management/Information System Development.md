## Project Effort Estimation

**Effort estimation** involves trade-offs between **functionality**, **time**, and **cost**. The process assigns **projected values** for time and effort, with the most accurate estimates coming from **experience**.

### Estimation methods:
- **Use-case point method**: 
  - Based on **technical complexity factors** (13) and **environmental factors** (8). An example can be seen in [[Karner Use Case Point Estimation]]
  
- **Function point approach**: 
  - Converts **function points** into **person-months**, which then determine **project duration**.

## Methods, Techniques, and Instruments in Project Identification

| **Methods**        | **Techniques**                            | **Instruments**       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Observation**     | Direct location visit                     | **Checklist**         |
| **Interview**       | Face-to-face, telephone, email, etc.      | **List of questions**  |
| **Questionnaires**  | Personal administration, email, etc.      | **Questionnaire**      |
| **Document search** | Direct location visit                     | **List of documents**  |
| **Sampling**        | Random, purposive, etc.                   | **Randomization**      |

## Project Management Tools

**Project management tools** aid in creating **workplans** by:
- **Identifying all tasks**, their sequence, and estimating the time to complete each task.
  
### Common tools:
- **Work breakdown structures (WBS)**: 
  - A hierarchy of tasks that helps to:
    - Identify the **duration** of each task
    - Track the **current status** of each task
    - Show **task dependencies** (which tasks must be completed before others can begin)
  
- **Gantt charts**: 
  - A **horizontal bar chart** that visually represents the WBS.

- **Network diagrams**: 
  - Examples include **PERT** (Program Evaluation Review Technique) and **CPM** (Critical Path Method).
