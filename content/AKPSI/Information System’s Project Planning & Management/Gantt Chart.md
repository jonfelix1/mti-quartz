# Gantt Chart

A **Gantt Chart** is a visual tool used in project management to illustrate the timeline of a project. It helps in tracking project progress, scheduling tasks, and managing resources effectively. 

## Key Features

- **Horizontal Bars**: Represent tasks or activities. The length of each bar indicates the duration of the task.
- **Timeline**: Shown on the horizontal axis, it represents the project’s timeframe, often broken down into days, weeks, or months.
- **Task Dependencies**: Visualizes relationships between tasks, showing which tasks need to be completed before others can start.
- **Milestones**: Important checkpoints or goals in the project are marked to track progress.

## Components

- **Tasks**: Listed on the vertical axis. Each task is represented by a horizontal bar spanning its start and end dates.
- **Timeline**: Shows the project’s schedule along the top of the chart. 
- **Dependencies**: Arrows or lines between tasks indicate dependencies or relationships.
- **Milestones**: Key events or deadlines are marked to track significant points in the project.
