# Scope Management

**Scope Management** involves controlling what is included and excluded in a project. It is crucial for ensuring that the project stays on track and does not expand beyond its original objectives, a phenomenon known as **scope creep**.

## Scope Creep

- **Definition**: Occurs when new requirements are added after the project has started, leading to increased scope beyond the original plan.
- **Effects**: Can negatively impact the project schedule and budget.

## Techniques to Manage Project Scope

1. **Identify All Requirements at the Outset**:
   - Gather and document all project requirements before starting the project.

2. **Allow Only Necessary Changes**:
   - Implement changes only if they are deemed absolutely necessary and beneficial.

3. **Examine the Impact of Changes**:
   - Assess how proposed changes will affect the project schedule, budget, and resources before approval.

4. **Delay Some Changes**:
   - Postpone non-essential changes for future enhancements to prevent scope creep.

5. **Time Boxing**:
   - Limit the amount of time dedicated to a particular task or project phase.

## Timeboxing Steps

1. **Set the Date for System Delivery**:
   - Establish a fixed deadline for when the system or project will be delivered.

2. **Prioritize Functionality**:
   - Determine which functionalities are most important and should be included in the initial release.

3. **Build Core Functionality**:
   - Focus on developing the most crucial features first.

4. **Postpone Less Critical Functionality**:
   - Delay features that cannot be developed within the allocated time frame.

5. **Deliver Core Functionality**:
   - Release the system with the core features completed.

6. **Iterate for Enhancements**:
   - Repeat the development process to add refinements and additional features in subsequent phases.



Effective scope management and [[Project Staffing]] are essential for keeping a project on track and ensuring its success. Properly managing scope helps prevent delays and cost overruns, while a well-structured staffing plan ensures that the project is adequately resourced and organized.
