# Feasibility Analysis

**Feasibility analysis** helps an organization decide whether to proceed with a project by answering critical questions:
- **Is this project feasible?**
- **What are the risks?**
  - Identify risks that need to be addressed if the project is approved
- **Can these risks be overcome?**

## Major Components:
- **Technical feasibility**: Can we build it?
- **Economic feasibility**: Should we build it?
- **Organizational feasibility**: Will they use it?

## Technical Feasibility

**Key factors** affecting technical feasibility:
- **Familiarity with technology**: Less familiarity introduces more risk.
- **Project size**: Larger projects carry more risk.
- **Compatibility**: Difficult integration increases risk.

**Key question**: **Can we build it?**

## Economic Feasibility

To determine **economic feasibility**, it is essential to:
- Identify the **costs** and **benefits**:
  - **Development costs**
  - **Annual operating costs**
  - **Annual benefits** (cost savings, revenues)
  - **Intangible costs** and benefits
- Determine the **cash flow**
- Assess value using methods like:
  - **Net present value (NPV)**
  - **Return on investment (ROI)**
  - **Break-even point**

**Cost-benefit analysis** is used to weigh the overall financial impact.
**Key question**: **Should we build it?**

## Organizational Feasibility

**Organizational feasibility** examines:
- Conducting a **stakeholder analysis** to identify:
  - **Project champion(s)**
  - **Senior management**
  - **Users**
  - **Other stakeholders**
- Whether the project is **strategically aligned** with the business.
- **User acceptance**: Will the users adopt the system?

**Key question**: **If we build it, will they use it?**
