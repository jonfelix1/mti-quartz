# Information System Project Selection

Projects are **approved**, **declined**, or **delayed** based on the **value added** compared to the **risks** as broken down in [[Feasibility Analysis]].

## Project Portfolio Management

**Goals** of project portfolio management:

- **Maximize** the **cost/benefit ratio**
- Maintain an **optimal mix** of projects based on:
    - **Risk**
    - **Size**, **cost**, and **length of time** to complete
    - **Purpose**, **scope**, and **business value**

**Limited resources** require **trade-offs**. Once selected, projects move into the **project management process**.

## How Not to Select a Project

Avoid selecting projects based on:
- **First in, first out**
- **Political clout** of the project inventor
- The **squeaky wheel** getting the grease
- Any method that lacks a **deliberate course of action analysis**

A recent analysis found that **2% to 15%** of projects undertaken by IT departments are **not strategic** to the business.

## Portfolio Matrix

Project can exist in 4 quadrants (categories):
- **High Value/Low Risk**: Projects in this category are usually prioritized as they offer high returns with minimal risk.
- **High Value/High Risk**: These projects offer significant benefits but come with substantial risks. They may require careful consideration and risk management strategies.
- **Low Value/Low Risk**: These projects are less critical but can be pursued if resources are available.
- **Low Value/High Risk**: Generally, these projects are avoided or deprioritized because they offer low benefits and come with high risks.
