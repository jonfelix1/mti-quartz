# Work Breakdown Structure

A **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** is a critical project management tool that helps in organizing and managing a project's scope by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Here’s a summary of the WBS:

## Workplan Overview

- **Definition**: A dynamic and sequential list of all tasks needed to complete a project.
- **Creation Timing**: Developed after the project manager has a general understanding of the project's size and rough schedule.
- **Usage**: Typically the main component in project management software applications.

## Approaches to Creating a WBS

1. **Modify Existing or Completed Projects**:
   - Use the structure of similar, past projects as a reference.
   - Adapt tasks and elements from previous projects to fit the new project's requirements.

2. **Derive Tasks from Methodology**:
   - Follow a specific project management methodology (e.g., Agile, Waterfall) to define tasks.
   - Ensure that the WBS aligns with the chosen methodology's framework and processes.

## Example Work Breakdown Structure Table

Here’s an example table illustrating a Work Breakdown Structure:


# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

| **Task ID** | **Task Name**                 | **Start Date** | **Completion Date** | **Person Assigned** | **Deliverable(s)**          | **Completion Status** | **Priority** | **Resources Needed** | **Estimated Time** | **Actual Time** |
|-------------|-------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1           | Define Project Scope           | Jan 1, 2010    | Jan 4, 2010         | John Doe            | Project Scope Document      | Complete               | High         | Document template     | 8 hours             | 7.5 hours        |
| 2           | Perform Economic Feasibility   | Jan 5, 2010    | Jan 19, 2010        | Mary Smith          | Cost-benefit Analysis       | Complete               | High         | Spreadsheet software  | 16 hours            | 14.5 hours       |
| 3           | Develop Project Plan           | Jan 20, 2010   | Feb 5, 2010         | Alice Johnson       | Project Plan Document       | In Progress            | Medium       | Project management tool | 20 hours            | -                |
| 4           | Review and Approve Plan        | Feb 6, 2010    | Feb 10, 2010        | Robert Brown        | Approved Project Plan       | Pending                | High         | -                     | 8 hours             | -                |
| 5           | Execute Project Tasks          | Feb 11, 2010   | Mar 15, 2010        | Various              | Progress Reports            | Not Started            | High         | Various               | -                   | -                |

| 7           | Project Closure                | Mar 16, 2010   | Mar 20, 2010        | Emily Davis         | Final Report                | Not Started            | Medium       | Final report template | 12 hours            | -                |


### Key Points

- **Workplan**: Essential for tracking and managing the project, ensuring that all tasks are accounted for and deadlines are met.
- **Dynamic Nature**: The WBS should be updated regularly as the project progresses and as more information becomes available.
- **Task Derivation**: Tasks can be derived from previous projects or methodologies to ensure completeness and relevance.

The WBS helps in organizing the project into manageable sections, making it easier to assign tasks, track progress, and ensure that all aspects of the project are addressed.
