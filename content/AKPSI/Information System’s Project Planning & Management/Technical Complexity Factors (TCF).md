# Technical Complexity Factors (TCF)

The **Technical Complexity Factor (TCF)** assesses the technical challenges and complexity of a project. It consists of **13 factors** that evaluate various technical aspects of the project. Each factor is rated on a scale from **0 to 5**, where higher values represent greater complexity.

## 13 Technical Complexity Factors

1. **Performance**:
    
    - How critical is performance? Will the system require high performance under heavy load?
    - Ratings: 0 (No impact) to 5 (High impact)
2. **Security**:
    
    - How secure does the system need to be? Are there stringent security requirements?
    - Ratings: 0 (No impact) to 5 (High impact)
3. **Concurrency**:
    
    - Does the system need to handle multiple processes or threads simultaneously?
    - Ratings: 0 (No impact) to 5 (High impact)
4. **Backup and Recovery**:
    
    - Are there stringent requirements for backup and data recovery?
    - Ratings: 0 (No impact) to 5 (High impact)
5. **Adaptability**:
    
    - How easily can the system adapt to changing requirements or environments?
    - Ratings: 0 (No impact) to 5 (High impact)
6. **Data Handling**:
    
    - How complex is the data handling (e.g., large volumes of data, complex data structures)?
    - Ratings: 0 (No impact) to 5 (High impact)
7. **Complexity of the User Interface**:
    
    - How complex is the user interface design and implementation?
    - Ratings: 0 (No impact) to 5 (High impact)
8. **Compliance**:
    
    - Are there specific compliance or regulatory requirements?
    - Ratings: 0 (No impact) to 5 (High impact)
9. **Interfacing with Other Systems**:
    
    - How complex is the integration with external systems or APIs?
    - Ratings: 0 (No impact) to 5 (High impact)
10. **Documentation Requirements**:
    
    - How extensive are the documentation requirements?
    - Ratings: 0 (No impact) to 5 (High impact)
11. **Development Tools**:
    
    - How complex are the development tools and technologies used?
    - Ratings: 0 (No impact) to 5 (High impact)
12. **Staff Experience**:
    
    - How experienced is the development team with the technology and project requirements?
    - Ratings: 0 (No impact) to 5 (High impact)
13. **Supportability**:
    
    - How easy will it be to support and maintain the system after deployment?
    - Ratings: 0 (No impact) to 5 (High impact)
