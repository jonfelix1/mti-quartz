# Business Process and Functional Modeling

**Business Process and Functional Modeling** refers to the process of transforming requirements into **functional models** that describe how a system should function, independent of its implementation (whether manual or computerized).

## Key Concepts

- **Logical Models**: The models are independent of the actual implementation, whether it is manual or computerized.
  
- **Use Cases**:
  - Describe how a business system interacts with its environment.
  - Each **use case** consists of:
    - A [[Use Case Diagram]] depicting the interaction between users and the system.
    - A [[Use Cases Description]] outlining the discrete activities users perform.
  
- [[Activity Diagram]]:
  - Derived from **use cases**.
  - They model business processes, illustrating how a business operates.
  - These diagrams show the **movement of objects** (typically data) between different activities.

Functional modeling is essential in ensuring that the system's design aligns with the business requirements and processes.
