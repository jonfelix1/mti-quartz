# Relationship Types

Relationship types represent meaningful associations between entities. The **degree of a relationship** refers to the number of participating entities:

- **Unary**: A single entity type involved.
- **Binary**: Two entity types involved (most common).
- **Ternary**: Three entity types involved.
- **Quaternary**: Four or more entities involved.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

An **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** is a graphical representation of entities and their relationships. It helps visualize:

- **Unary relationships**: Where one entity is related to itself (e.g., **Staff** supervises **Staff**).
- **Binary relationships**: Common between two entities (e.g., **Branch** has **Staff**).
- **Ternary relationships**: Involving three entities, e.g., **Supplier** supplies **Product** to **Customer**.

### Relationship with Attributes

Relationships can also have attributes. For example, the relationship between a **Customer** and **Order** might include an attribute such as **OrderDate**.
