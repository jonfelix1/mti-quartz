# Entity Types

Entity types are abstractions that represent real-world objects or concepts that have an independent existence.




## Strong Entity Type 

- **Physical Entities**: Tangible items like **Staff**, **Property**, and **Product**.

- A **Strong Entity Type** is an entity that does not rely on any other entity for its existence.

## Weak Entity Type
- **Conceptual Entities**: Intangible concepts like **Sale**, **Course**, or **Inspection**.

- A **Weak Entity Type** is dependent on another entity for its existence. It is represented by a double rectangle in ER diagrams. An example is a **Dependent** entity type that relies on the **Employee** entity.
