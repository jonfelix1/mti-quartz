Attributes can be further classified based on their structure and value types:

## Simple Attribute

A simple attribute has a single value that exists independently, such as **Name** or **Age**.

## Composite Attribute

A composite attribute is made up of multiple components. For instance, a **Name** attribute might consist of **FirstName** and **LastName**.

## Multi-valued Attribute

An attribute that can have multiple values for each entity. For example, an employee might have multiple **PhoneNumbers**.

## Derived Attribute

A derived attribute is calculated or inferred from other attributes. For instance, an employee's **Age** can be derived from their **DateOfBirth**.
