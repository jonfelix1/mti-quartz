# Data Modelling and Design

Data modelling is a systematic process that involves discovering, analysing, and defining data requirements to create a **data model**. This model serves as a blueprint for how data is structured and interrelated within an organization, facilitating effective **data management**. According to Simsion (2013), the modelling process helps organizations understand how their data fits together.

## Objectives

The key objectives of data modelling and design include:

- Understanding data modelling within the **DMBOK** framework.
- Identifying main stages of the **database system development lifecycle**.
- Exploring phases of database design: **conceptual**, **logical**, and **physical**.

## Data Models

Data models are essential for organizations to comprehend their data assets. They consist of:

- **Entities**
- **Relationships**
- **Facts**
- **Keys**
- **Attributes**

### Goals of Data Modelling

The primary goals include:

- **Formalization**: Documenting clear definitions of data structures and relationships.
  
- **Scope Definition**: Outlining boundaries for data context and implementation.

- **Knowledge Retention**: Preserving corporate memory regarding systems or projects.
