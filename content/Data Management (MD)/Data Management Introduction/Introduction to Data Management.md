# Introduction to Data Management

This is the overview of what will be studied in Data Management Course

Data management encompasses a structured approach for developing and implementing detailed policies to handle data within an organization. It includes **frameworks**, **standards**, **projects**, **teams**, and **maturity** models that ensure the proper handling, security, and utilization of data. Since **information** is a core component of any IT system, understanding how to manage data effectively is crucial for organizational success.

## Nature of Data

- **Data** is the fuel for applications, enabling them to function.
- Applications exist primarily to process **data** supplied by users, devices, or other systems.
- **Infrastructure** (hardware and software) is responsible for storing and managing data.
- Data is a key **organizational asset**. Its value lies in its ability to provide insights, enable decision-making, and drive business processes.
- Organizations have significant **responsibilities** to manage and protect their data.

## Data, Information, & Knowledge

### Data
- Data represents raw **facts** in various forms, such as **text**, **numbers**, **graphics**, **images**, **sound**, or **video**.
- It is the raw material for creating **information** but lacks inherent meaning without context.

### Information
- **Information** is the interpretation of **data** in context, making it understandable and useful.
- By organizing data around context, we give it meaning.

### Knowledge
- **Knowledge** is derived from **information** that has been integrated into a broader **perspective**, recognizing patterns, trends, and relationships.
- Knowledge enables understanding, which in turn leads to more effective actions and decisions.

## Managing the Data Paradigm

- Between 1950 and 2002, only 5 billion gigabytes of digital data were created.
- By 2011, this same volume of data was created every two days, and by 2013, it was being generated every ten minutes.
- The exponential growth of data has made traditional tools and techniques inadequate for managing modern data volumes, requiring new approaches and technologies.

## Rise of Data-Centric Organizations

In modern business, the use of **data** has become a core driver of success. Organizations are increasingly **data-centric**, making **data** the foundation for strategic decision-making, much like how **hardware** and **software** have historically been the key elements of IT.

- The importance of **data** now rivals traditional physical assets.
- Data is crucial for operations, driving business decisions, and enabling automation and innovation.

## Information as an Organizational Asset

- Organizations manage their **tangible assets** using inventory and asset management systems.
- **Data**, though less tangible, is equally valuable but is often not treated with the same level of rigor in terms of management and valuation.
- High-quality, accurate, and accessible **information** is essential for efficient operations.

## Generalized Information Management Lifecycle

To properly manage data, organizations follow a generalized lifecycle that encompasses several stages:

1. **Enter, Create, Acquire, Derive, Update, Capture** – This phase involves generating or capturing data from various sources.
2. **Store, Manage, Replicate, Distribute** – Data is stored, managed, and made available across the organization.
3. **Protect and Recover** – Safeguarding data from loss or breaches and ensuring the ability to recover data when needed.
4. **Archive and Recall** – Long-term storage of data, ensuring it can be retrieved when necessary.
5. **Delete/Remove** – Properly disposing of data when it is no longer needed or relevant.

### Expanded Information Management Lifecycle

The lifecycle can also include phases for the **planning**, **design**, and **implementation** of the infrastructure required to support information management.

- This expanded lifecycle includes:
  - **Plan, Design, Specify** – Designing the infrastructure and processes required to manage the data lifecycle.
  - **Implement Underlying Infrastructure** – Executing the design by setting up the necessary hardware and software.

## Data and Information Management

**Data management** is the business process that plans and executes policies, practices, and projects for handling **data assets**. This process includes:

- **Acquisition** – Gathering data from various sources.
- **Control** – Ensuring the integrity and security of data.
- **Protection** – Safeguarding data from unauthorized access and breaches.
- **Delivery** – Making the right data available to the right people at the right time.
- **Enhancement** – Continuously improving the quality and value of data.

## Data Management Goals

### Primary Goals

- **Understand enterprise information needs**: Know what information is needed by the organization and its stakeholders.
- **Capture, store, and protect data**: Ensure the integrity and security of data throughout its lifecycle.
- **Improve data quality**: Continuously enhance the **accuracy**, **relevance**, **integration**, and **usefulness** of data.
- **Ensure privacy and confidentiality**: Prevent unauthorized or inappropriate use of data and safeguard sensitive information.
- **Maximize data value**: Ensure that data is used effectively to drive decision-making and create business value.

### Secondary Goals

- **Control data management costs**: Ensure that data management efforts are cost-effective.
- **Promote the value of data assets**: Help stakeholders recognize and appreciate the strategic importance of **data assets**.
- **Manage data consistently**: Ensure that data is handled in a consistent and standardized manner across the organization.
- **Align data efforts with business needs**: Ensure that data management initiatives support broader business objectives.

## Data Management Principles

- **Data and information are valuable enterprise assets**: They must be treated with the same level of care as other important business resources.
- **Shared responsibility**: Data management is a joint responsibility between **business data owners** and **IT professionals**.
- **Data management is a business function**: It encompasses a set of disciplines that ensure the effective use, protection, and management of data assets.

## Data Management Functions

The organizational data management function involves the development, execution, and supervision of:

- **Plans** – Strategies for managing data.
- **Policies** – Guidelines for ensuring data integrity and security.
- **Programs and Projects** – Specific initiatives aimed at enhancing data management.
- **Processes and Practices** – Day-to-day activities that ensure the smooth operation of data management functions.

## Data Management Challenges

Some common data management challenges include:

- **Discovery**: Difficulty in finding the right data.
- **Integration**: Challenges in combining data from different sources.
- **Insight**: Extracting value and insights from data.
- **Dissemination**: Making data available to those who need it.
- **Management**: Handling large volumes of data efficiently.

## Data Management Frameworks

Several frameworks exist to guide organizations in managing data:

- **TOGAF**: Provides a high-level process for creating a **data architecture** within an overall enterprise architecture.
- **DMBOK**: A detailed framework focused on managing data throughout its lifecycle.
- **COBIT**: Provides guidelines for IT governance, including controls for data management processes.

## DMBOK (Data Management Body of Knowledge)

Developed by the **Data Management Association (DAMA)**, **DMBOK** is a comprehensive framework for managing data across its entire lifecycle. It includes:

- **Goals and Principles**: Fundamental concepts guiding data management functions.
- **Activities**: Specific actions taken within each data management function.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Who is responsible for performing each activity.
- **Techniques and Tools**: Common methods and software used to manage data effectively.

### DMBOK Knowledge Areas

DMBOK defines 11 key **Knowledge Areas** that provide a comprehensive guide for managing data:

- **Data Governance**: Establishing the rules and policies that govern data management.
- **Data Architecture**: Defining the overall structure of data within the organization.
- **Data Modeling & Design**: Creating precise models that represent data requirements.
- **Data Storage & Operations**: Managing the storage, retrieval, and operation of data systems.
- **Data Security**: Protecting data from breaches and unauthorized access.
- **Data Integration & Interoperability**: Ensuring data flows smoothly across different systems.
- **Data Quality**: Continuously assessing and improving the quality of data.
