![[Pasted image 20240903200142.png#invert_B]]

**Data Governance Bodies:**
- **Data Governance Steering Committee:** The highest authority in data governance, responsible for oversight, support, and funding. It consists of senior executives and oversees data governance activities, often approving funding based on recommendations.
- **Data Governance Council (DGC):** Manages data governance initiatives, including policy development and issue resolution. Composed of executives based on the organization's operating model.
- **Data Governance Office (DGO):** Focuses on maintaining enterprise-level data definitions and management standards. It includes roles such as data stewards, custodians, and data owners.
- **Data Stewardship Teams:** Groups that concentrate on specific data-related subjects or projects, working on data definitions and standards. These teams consist of both business and technical data stewards and data analysts.
- **Local Data Governance Committee:** Found in large organizations, these committees handle data governance at divisional or departmental levels under the Enterprise DGC. Smaller organizations typically avoid this level of complexity.
