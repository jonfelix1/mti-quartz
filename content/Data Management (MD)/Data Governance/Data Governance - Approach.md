# Data Governance: Approach

## Decision Making
- **Shared decision-making** is a key aspect of data governance, involving collaboration across organizational and system boundaries.
- **Business decisions** are often made with input and guidance from IT.
- **Technical decisions** are typically made with input and guidance from business data stewards at all levels.

## Implementation
- [[Data Governance]] is best implemented as an ongoing program and continuous improvement process.
- Each [[Data Governance]] program is **unique**, tailored to **specific organizational** and **cultural contexts** and current data management needs.
- It requires **organizational [[Change Management]]**.
- [[Data Governance]] is distinct from **IT governance**.
