![[Pasted image 20240903200944.png|invert]]


Data Governance has 3 generally accepted models:
- **Centralized Model:** A single Data Governance organization oversees all data governance activities across all subject areas.
- **Replicated Model:** Each business unit adopts the same Data Governance operating model and standards, replicating the central model.
- **Federated Model:** A central Data Governance organization coordinates with multiple business units to ensure consistent data definitions and standards across the organization.
