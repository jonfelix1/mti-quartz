# Architectural Frameworks
Architectural frameworks provide structured ways to understand and develop complex systems. Popular ones include:
- **Zachman Framework**: A widely adopted model for enterprise architecture.
- **TOGAF**: A methodology for developing enterprise architecture.
- **DODAF**: A framework used by the US Department of Defense.
- **FEA**: US Federal Enterprise Architecture.

These frameworks are used to organize the different views and perspectives needed to design and manage a complex system.
