2. **Master Data Domain**: Core data entities like customers and products.
3. **Operational Data Domain**: Transactional data created by daily business activities.
4. **Unstructured Data Domain**: Data like documents, media, and emails.
5. **Analytical Data Domain**: Data transformed for decision-making and analysis.

### Key Definitions:
