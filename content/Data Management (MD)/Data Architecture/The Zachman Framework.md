# The Zachman Framework
The Zachman Framework is a widely recognized tool for organizing and structuring complex systems. It uses a **6x6 matrix** that divides system architecture into:
- **Rows**: Representing different **stakeholder perspectives**, from planners and designers to implementers and users.
- **Columns**: Representing **key questions** (What, How, Where, Who, When, and Why), corresponding to data, function, network, people, time, and motivation.

Each cell in the matrix represents a unique **model** for the system.

### Example:
- **Planner’s view**: High-level lists of system elements.
- **Owner’s view**: Business models showing relationships between elements.
- **Designer’s view**: Detailed logical models describing system requirements.
