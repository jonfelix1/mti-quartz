# What is Architecture?
Architecture involves designing any **complex system**—whether it’s a building, a software system, or even an organization. The purpose is to manage complexity and ensure that the components work together efficiently.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Design**: Human-made systems or natural systems can have architecture (e.g., biology, software, organizations).
- **Levels of Design**: Architecture spans macro (city planning) to micro (machine parts).
- **Abstraction**: Architecture provides a high-level overview without diving into the detailed system.

It requires a combination of **analysis** (understanding requirements) and **design** (structuring components to meet those needs).
