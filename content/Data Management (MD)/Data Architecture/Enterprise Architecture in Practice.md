# Enterprise Architecture in Practice
Enterprise architecture helps organizations manage both **business and IT models**. It typically includes:
- **As-is**: Current state of systems.
- **Target state**: Where the architecture aims to go.
- **Transition states**: Intermediate steps to reach the target state.

Benefits of enterprise architecture include:
- Aligning IT with business strategy.
- Reducing IT infrastructure costs.
- Enabling effective resource coordination.
- Improving decision-making and business agility.
