# Data Storage and Operations

Data Storage and Operations involves the **design**, **implementation**, and **support** of stored data to maximize its value from creation to disposal. The key activities include:

- **Database Support**: Focuses on the data lifecycle, including implementation, backup, and purging.

- **Data Technology Management**: Defines technical requirements, installs technology, and resolves related issues.

## Goals and Principles

### Goals

- **Data Availability**: Manage the accessibility of data throughout its lifecycle.

- **Data Integrity**: Ensure the accuracy and consistency of data assets.

- **Performance Management**: Oversee efficient data transactions.

### Principles

- **Automation Opportunities**: Automate processes to reduce errors and rework.

- **Reuse**: Develop reusable data objects to prevent tight coupling with database schemas.

- **Best Practices**: Apply best practices in database management.
