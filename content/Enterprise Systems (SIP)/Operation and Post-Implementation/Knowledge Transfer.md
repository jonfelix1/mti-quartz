- Key areas such as **project monitoring**, **collaboration**, **subject matter expertise**, and **lessons learned** should be **documented**.

**Knowledge Management Plan**:

- Helps **retain knowledge**, **reduce support costs**, and **facilitate faster learning**.
- Enhances system capabilities, speeds up **problem troubleshooting**, and ensures **correct system usage**.
- A **centralized data repository** can be used to store documents, preventing confusion, duplication, and data loss.
