# Stabilization Period

**Stabilization Process**:

- Begins once the **ERP system is live**, initial training is completed, and critical data conversion is done.
- Typically lasts **60 to 90 days** after Go-live.
- **IT staff** monitors system infrastructure for response times and ensures proper backup procedures.
- **Subject matter experts** assist users in operating the system correctly.

**Issues During Stabilization**:

- **Customizations** may complicate processes if they aren't documented or communicated properly.
- Users may struggle with **ad hoc activities** due to unfamiliarity, not system limitations.
- Errors arise as users adapt to new processes.
- **Parallel implementation** with legacy systems can lead to confusion and high labor demands.
- **Reconciliation** between ERP and legacy systems is necessary to validate data inputs and outputs.
