# Operation and Post-Implementation

Handles operational stage of ERP. First step is to assess [[Go-Live Readiness]]. As it's ready, an [[ERP Training]] is needed to train staff in using it. Extensive monitoring is needed during the [[Stabilization Period]]. After it has been deployed successfully, the next step is [[Post-Production Support]] and [[Knowledge Transfer]].

## Implications for Management

- **Focus on Project Management**: As the ERP implementation nears its **Go-live** date, project management must intensify its focus on:
    
    - Identifying issues.
    - Managing tasks and activities to allocate resources effectively.
- **Knowledge Transfer Process**: A well-defined and understood **knowledge transfer process** is essential for a successful and sustainable ERP implementation, especially when:
    
    - Consultants, implementation partner staff, full-time and part-time staff, and end-users depart.

## Summary

- **Readiness Assessment**: Evaluating readiness in an ERP implementation is crucial for the overall process. Without this assessment, meeting the **Go-live** date confidently can be challenging.
    
- **Training Plan**: A strong ERP implementation training plan should include:
    
    - **Just-in-time** and continual training.
- **Stabilization Period**: The stabilization phase generally lasts **60-90 days** following the **Go-live** date, depending on the number of issues encountered.
    
- **Postproduction Support**: This support assists production staff, users, and IT staff in understanding:
    
    - Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly expectations from the system.
