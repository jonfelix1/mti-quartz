# Vendor Demonstrations and Evaluation

## Considerations

- Some companies may want the ERP application to work on an **existing platform**.
- Certain ERP applications only operate on specific platforms, which can limit options.
- It is beneficial to have the vendor install a **“sandbox” application** for demonstration purposes on the company’s existing infrastructure to assess compatibility and functionality.
