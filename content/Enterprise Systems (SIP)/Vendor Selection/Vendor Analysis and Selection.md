# Vendor Analysis and Selection

## Evaluation Process

- **Organize Evaluation Teams**:
    - **Office Staff**: Evaluate the **functionality** of the ERP system.
    - **IT Staff**: Assess the **technology requirements** needed to support the system.
    - **Contract Staff**: Review the **contract** terms and **pricing** of the system.
- Coordinate efforts to select a small number of **top vendors** for further consideration.

## Selection Criteria

- Recognize that no vendor will meet all requirements; thus, vendor discussions and negotiations should focus on finding the **best fit** for the business.
- **Develop and analyze** the **total cost of ownership (TCO)** to understand the long-term financial implications of each vendor option.
