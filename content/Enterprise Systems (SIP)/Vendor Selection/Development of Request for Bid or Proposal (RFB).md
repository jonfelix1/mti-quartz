# Development of Request for Bid or Proposal (RFB)

## Overview

- Often referred to as a **Request for Proposals (RFP)**.
- This process can be **expensive** and **time-consuming** for both the company and the vendor but can yield significant software savings when executed effectively.

## Essential Components of an RFB

The RFB should always include the following:

- **Type of ERP System**: Clearly define the desired ERP system along with specific functionality.
- **Specified Hardware and Software Infrastructure**: Detail the necessary infrastructure that supports the ERP system.
- **Training Requirements**: Outline the training needed for staff to effectively use the new system.
- **Contract Issues**: Include any specific contract stipulations required by the company.
