- **Blockchain** is a **shared ledger technology** that allows any participant in a business network to access a **system of record** (ledger).
- [[Blockchain Key Characteristics]]
- Fundamentally, a blockchain is an **immutable**, **distributed ledger**.

## Key Features

- Blockchain is a **mathematical framework** designed to **securely store data**, making it highly **tamper-resistant**. Transactions are handled by [[Validating and Mining Transactions]]
- It is suitable for securely tracking a wide range of information such as:
  - **Account & trade balances**
  - **Ownership of property**
  - **Taxes**
  - **Births, deaths, marriages**
  - **Charges, transactions, property sales**
  
## Economic Infrastructure

- Blockchain is a **new economic infrastructure** that maintains **records**.
- Using blockchain, participants can **exchange value** easily, just like sending a text message, without relying on a **central authority** to verify transactions.

- The first use of blockchain was with **Bitcoin**, where each **node** on the network keeps a duplicate of the ledger.
- **Miners** solve cryptographic puzzles to create a **universally accepted record** of transactions.

## Trust and Traceability

- Blockchain promotes **automated trust**, securely sharing sensitive data and providing **visibility** into who has accessed or modified it.
- This ensures **full traceability** of transactions and records.

## Contract Management

- **Smart contracts** on the blockchain automate record-keeping and sharing.
- They eliminate the need for:
  - **Manual contracts**
  - **Invoice reconciliation**
  - **Manual signatures**

## Data Sharing

- Blockchain ensures that stored information is **immutable** and **resistant to tampering**.
- It enables the use of:
  - **Digital certificates**
  - **Digital signatures**
  - **Tracing the history of a product** before purchase
