## Public Blockchain

- No **permission** is required to enter and perform transactions.
- Lacks a central entity overseeing the network, making it **tamper-proof** by any single individual.
- Examples include cryptocurrencies like **Ethereum**, **Bitcoin**, and **Litecoin**.

## Private Blockchain

- Also known as **permissioned blockchain**.
- Managed by specific entities within an organization that control access and can revoke permissions.
- Commonly used in **supply chain management** to ensure that sensitive information remains confidential to the team.

## Hybrid Blockchain

- Combines features of both **public** and **private** blockchains.
- **Public nodes** allow anyone to join and participate in the network.
- **Private nodes** verify and validate transactions, controlled by specific organizations or individuals.
- This setup enables faster transaction processing while enhancing **privacy** and **security**.
- Public nodes provide **decentralization** and **transparency**, preventing any single entity from monopolizing control.
- Participants can determine who can join the blockchain and which transactions are accessible to the public.
