# Blockchain Key Characteristics 

## Distributed

- **Everyone holds a copy** of the ledger.
- These copies are **automatically synchronized**, ensuring consistency across the network.

## Shared

- All **transactions are transparent** and visible to everyone participating in the blockchain.

## Immutability

- Once data is written to the blockchain, it becomes **immutable**â€”no one can alter or change it.


## Shared Ledger

- **Records all transactions** across the business network.
- **Shared** between participants, with each participant having their own copy through **replication**.
- **Permissioned** access ensures participants see only **appropriate transactions**.
- Acts as the **shared system of record** for the network.

## Smart Contracts

- **Smart contracts** are **predefined protocols** that automatically **execute** or oversee events based on the terms of an agreement.
- They aim to create **transparency** and **eliminate third-party intermediaries**, reducing the risk of **fraud** or **malicious actions**.
- Each transaction generates a **smart contract**, and the transaction is recorded on the blockchain.
- Once established, **smart contracts cannot be changed**.

## Applications of Smart Contracts

- Smart contracts can **automate processes** such as:
  - **Financial transactions**
  - **Service delivery**
  - **Authorization** for digital content access
  - **Enforcement of privacy safeguards**
  
- **Walmart Canada** uses smart contracts in a **blockchain-based freight-invoicing system**:
  - They integrate **real-time shipment data** into invoices.
  - Payments are **preapproved** once the conditions in the shipping agreement are met.
