[[System Architecture]]for Enterprise


## Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and [[System Integration]]

- **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** systems are **integrated**, multi-module software packages that support various **business functions** across an organization.
- ERP systems facilitate the **collection** and **integration** of information across different areas.
- They enable organizations to **standardize** and improve their **business processes**, helping implement **best practices** for the industry.

    - **Client level** → Standardizing all **client platforms**.
    - **Application level** → Ensuring a **common user-interface design**, back-end **system access**, and effective **backup** and **recovery plans**.


## Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Architecture

- **ERP system architecture** is organized in **layers** or **tiers** to manage **system complexity**, providing **scalability** and **flexibility**. 
- Can be broken down to [[ERP Modules]]for every **business functions**.

## Implication for Management
- **Enterprise architecture** is crucial for the **long-term functioning** of an organization.
