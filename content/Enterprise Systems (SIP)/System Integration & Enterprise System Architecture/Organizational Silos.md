# Organizational Silos (Functional Silos)

Adam Smith division of labor

- **Silos** are compartmentalized **operating units** isolated from their environment, leading to inefficiencies in overall organizational collaboration.
- **Adam Smith** introduced the concept of **division of labor**, which emphasized breaking down tasks into specialized roles to increase **efficiency** and **productivity**.
- In **functional silos**, this **division of labor** can be taken too far, where **departments** work in isolation, losing sight of the **overall objectives** of the organization.
- While **division of labor** promotes **specialization**, it can lead to inefficiencies in communication and coordination when departments don't collaborate, as is the case in **functional silos**.

## Horizontal Silos

- Organizations are divided into **departments** like **Accounting** and **Human Resources**.
- This reflects the concept of breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable ones that can be assigned to **specific groups**.

## Vertical Silos

- **CEOs** and **Presidents** focus on **long-term strategy**, midlevel managers on **tactical issues**, and **lower-level management** on daily operations.
- Functional grouping often promotes a **narrow focus** on improving a specific department, leading to **intraorganizational friction** and misalignment with the organizationâ€™s broader goals.
