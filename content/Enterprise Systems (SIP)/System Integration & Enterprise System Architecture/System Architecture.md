# System Architecture

- **System Architecture** is a representation of a system, including:
    - A mapping of **functionality** onto **hardware** and **software** components.
    - A mapping of **software architecture** onto **hardware architecture**.
    - **Human interaction** with these components.

## Why Study Enterprise Systems Architecture?

- Helps **management** and **implementation teams** understand the features and components of the **enterprise system** in detail.
- Provides a **visual representation** of complex system interfaces among **ERP applications**, **databases**, **operating systems**, **legacy applications**, and **networking**.
- Enables management to develop a better **IT plan**.

- **Functional Angle**:
    
    - Defines the **ERP modules** that support various **business functions** of the organization.

        - **Sales Management**
        - Etc.
- **System Angle**:
    
    - Defines the **ERP architecture** through the physical components of **hardware**, **software**, and **networking**.
