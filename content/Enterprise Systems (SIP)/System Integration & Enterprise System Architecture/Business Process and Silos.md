# Business Process and Silos

- The problem of **functional silos** led to the development of **Business Process Re-engineering (BPR)**.
- A **business process** offers an alternative way of grouping people and resources, focusing on the **organization's activities**, even if it crosses traditional **functional areas**.

## Cross-Functional Business Process

- Involves people and resources from various **functional departments** working together, sharing information at all levels of the organization.
- Breaks down **functional silos** by enabling **informational flows** between departments.
- Facilitates **organizational changes**, as some organizations are shifting from **process orientation** to **customer orientation**.
