# Systems Integration

- **Logical Integration**:
    - Develop information systems that enable organizations to **share data** with all stakeholders based on **need** and **authorization**.
    - Management must adjust **organizational structures**, **processes**, and **employee roles** and responsibilities.
- **Physical Integration**:
    
    - Provide **seamless connectivity** between heterogeneous systems.
- **Business Process Reengineering**:
    
    - Involves changing the mindset of employees to encourage and enable them to perform tasks in a **new way**.

- **Problems**
	- [[Organizational Silos]] is generally bad for organizations as broken down in [[Business Process and Silos]]


## Steps in Integrating Systems
These problems are solved by implementing a [[Enterprise System Architecture (ESA)]]

1. **Resource Categorization**:
    - Take an inventory of hardware and software resources, focusing on **vendors**, **operating systems**, and **IS architecture**.
2. **Compliance and Standards**:
    - Ensure that databases and technologies used support relevant **standards**.
3. **Legacy Systems Support**:
    - Develop a **policy** to support older **legacy applications**.
4. **Middleware Tools**:
    - Use **middleware tools** for integration if existing applications must be utilized in the short term.
5. **Authentication and Authorization Policies**:
    - Implement a **single sign-on** policy for application and data access to enable **access** from anywhere, anytime.
6. **Centralized IT Services and Support**:
    - Ensure IT staff can support all applications and platforms through a **centralized IT help desk**.
7. **Back-up, Recovery, and Security**:
    - Establish a robust **back-up** and **recovery system** to handle system failures or major disasters.
8. **Hardware and Software Standardization**:
    - Develop organizational standards and policies for acquiring new **hardware** and **software** that align with the IT strategy.

## Implication for Management
- **Silos do not work** effectively within an organization.

### Benefits of System Integration

### Challenges of System Integration

- **System integration** presents several **challenges**, such as:
    - **Replacing old hardware** and **software**.
    - Working with **IT consultants**.
    - Addressing **human challenges**, including:
        - Impact on **IT staff**.
