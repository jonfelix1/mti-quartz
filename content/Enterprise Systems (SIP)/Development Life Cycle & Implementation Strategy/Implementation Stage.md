# Implementation Stage

- **Focus**: Installing and releasing the system to end-users and monitoring its usage.
- **Feedback**: System usage feedback should be directed to the post-implementation team for ongoing support.

## Approaches to System Conversion:

1. **Phased Conversion**:
    - The new system is implemented **in stages** or modules, one part at a time.
    - Reduces risk by allowing gradual adaptation to the new system.
    - Example: Implementing the new system in one department first, then moving to others after successful testing.
2. **Pilot Conversion**:
    
    - The new system is introduced to a **small group of users** before a full rollout.
    - Helps to identify issues in a controlled environment before broader implementation.
    - Example: Testing the system with one branch or office before deploying it across the organization.
3. **Parallel Conversion**:
    
    - The new and old systems **run simultaneously** for a certain period.
    - Allows comparison between the two systems, ensuring the new system works correctly before decommissioning the old one.
    - Reduces risk, but it's resource-intensive as both systems require maintenance during the overlap.
4. **Direct Cutover (Big Bang)**:
    
    - The old system is completely **replaced by the new system** in one go.
    - **High risk** but also **fastest approach** if successful.
    - Example: A company switches to the new system over a weekend, with the old system decommissioned once the new one is operational.

## When to use each System Conversion
- **Phased Conversion**:
    
    - Best for **large, complex systems** where implementing everything at once could be risky.
    - Allows gradual transition and easier management of any issues.
    - Suitable when you want to **minimize disruption** to the organization.
- **Pilot Conversion**:
    
    - Useful when you're **unsure** of how the system will perform and want to **test** it in a smaller, controlled environment.
    - Ideal for organizations that can afford to experiment with a single department or group.
    - Good for **risk management**, as you can iron out problems before a full-scale rollout.
- **Parallel Conversion**:
    
    - Used when the organization needs **high reliability** and **cannot afford downtime** or loss of data.
    - Suitable for **critical systems** where both old and new systems run together to ensure the new one functions correctly.
    - Helps reduce risk, but can be **resource-intensive** as both systems need to be maintained simultaneously.
- **Direct Cut (Big Bang)**:
    
    - Works well for **smaller systems** or organizations with **limited complexity**.
    - Chosen when a **quick transition** is needed, and the business can tolerate some risk and potential downtime.
    - Best when **time or cost constraints** do not allow for a phased or parallel approach.
