# ERP Development Life Cycle

- **SDLC** involves a **systematic process** of **planning, designing**, and **creating an information system** for organizations.
- Its purpose is to **avoid mishaps** and **coordinate tasks** efficiently among the **large systems development team**.

## ERP vs Other Packaged Software
- **ERP Systems** cost **millions of dollars**, while **other packaged software** ranges from **hundreds to thousands**.
- **ERP** is often **mission-critical**, while **other software** supports **productivity improvements**.
- **ERP implementation** can take **one to several years**, whereas **other software** can be deployed **almost instantly**.
- Success in **ERP implementation** requires a **significant change management strategy** from start to finish, including **business process changes, training, and communications**.
- **Other software** requires some **training** and **support**.
- **ERP** demands **in-house employee time**, **consultant** involvement, and **vendor support** costing **millions of dollars**.
- **Other software** needs **little to no consulting** or **vendor technical support**.

## Comparing and Contrasting SDLC with ERPLC

| Aspect                 | SDLC                                          | ERP Life Cycle                                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Goal**              | Develop a new system to support organizational requirements. | Implement a packaged system to support organizational requirements. |
| **Analysis**          | Evaluate user needs through observations and interviews, and create system specifications. | Vendor analysis and evaluation of business process changes due to implementation. |
| **Design**            | Develop new system architecture, user interface, and reporting tools. | Installation and customization plan of ERP software, data conversion, and change management strategies. |
| **Implementation**    | Acquire hardware and software, develop applications, installation, testing, training, and conversion. | “Go-Live” conversion or releasing the system to users, along with training and support. |
| **Consultant Role**   | Provides technical support mainly during design and implementation. | Involves change management, process change, and technical support from beginning to end. |
| **Management Role**   | Some oversight and support.                   | Significant oversight and involvement, especially in change management. |
| **End-User Role**     | Focus group providing input during various stages, with most involvement during the implementation stage. | Multiple groups such as **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)**, advanced users, and self-service users are part of the implementation team with continuous involvement. |
| **Operations**        | Maintains, updates, and provides technical support. | Maintains, updates, upgrades, and monitors the change management strategy. |
