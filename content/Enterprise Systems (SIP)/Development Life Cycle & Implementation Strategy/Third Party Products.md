# Third Party Products

- **Third-party products** refer to add-on software components designed to either make the system operational or to add missing functionality.
- These products can be either purchased or developed in-house.

## Functionalities of Third-Party Products

- **Operational software** may enable the new ERP system to:
    - Distribute reports.
    - Permit a **single user ID** and **password**.
    - Enforce a higher level of **security**.
    - Improve **system performance monitoring**.

## Integration Considerations

- Although these systems are not necessarily **integrated** with the ERP system, the data or services need to work with the system on a regular basis and must operate **seamlessly**.

## Example

- An example of a third-party product is an **advanced marketing add-on** used to track comments, monitor trends, or share updates.
