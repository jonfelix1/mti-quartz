# Change Management

- **System failures** often occur when insufficient attention is given to **change management** from the early stages.
- A **vision** for **change management** (CM) needs to be articulated from the **first stage** and then **revised**, **monitored**, and **implemented** consistently.
- Support from **top management** and the skills of the **change management team** are essential for successful implementation.
