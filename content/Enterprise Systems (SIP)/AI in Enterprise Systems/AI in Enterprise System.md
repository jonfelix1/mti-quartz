## Types of AI

- **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)**: Task-specific AI, e.g., smart speakers, self-driving cars.
- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**: Broad AI, capable of performing any task a human can do.

## How AI Works

- **Supervised Learning (A to B)**: Examples include spam filtering, speech recognition, and machine translation.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Trained to predict the next word in a sequence, like ChatGPT.

## Data in AI

- **Data Acquisition**: Data is collected through manual labeling, observing user behavior, or partnerships.
- **Data Quality**: The success of AI depends on the quality of the data; issues like incorrect labels and missing values affect outcomes.
