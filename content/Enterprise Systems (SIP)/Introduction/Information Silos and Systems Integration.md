# Information Silos and Systems Integration

- Over time, **Information Systems (IS)** can lead to a **hodgepodge** of independent, **nonintegrated systems**, creating **bottlenecks** and reducing **productivity**.
- Organizations need to be **agile** and **flexible**, requiring integrated **data**, **applications**, and **resources** across the entire organization.
- To **compete effectively**, organizations must be **customer-focused**.
- This requires **cross-functional integration** among departments like **accounting**, **marketing**, and others.

## Evolution of Systems Integration

- Since the **early 1990s**, most organizations have aimed to remove **functional barriers**.
- This led to the creation of **business units** that integrate personnel from various functional areas to collaborate on projects.
- These units are **created and eliminated** based on organizational needs.
