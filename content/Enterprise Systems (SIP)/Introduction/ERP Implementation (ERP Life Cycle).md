# ERP Implementation (ERP Life Cycle)

- **ERP system implementations** are risky. A **well-defined project plan** with a **proven methodology** helps manage these risks.
- The key to success is to follow a step-by-step **methodology** starting with **planning** and understanding the **ERP life cycle**.
- This is discussed deeper in [[ERP Development Life Cycle]]

## Software and Vendor Selection

- Organizations lacking ERP development experience should **purchase** an existing system.
- Before selecting a **vendor**, organizations should evaluate their **current** and **future needs** for **enterprise management systems**.
- Review the **hardware**, **network**, and **software infrastructure**, along with available **resources** for implementation.

## [[Vendor Selection]]

- Considerations for vendor selection include:
    - Supported **business functions** or **modules**.
    - Software **features** and **integration capabilities**.
    - Vendorâ€™s **financial viability** and business history.
    - **Licensing** and **upgrade policies**.
    - **Customer service** and **help desk support**.
    - **Total cost of ownership**.
    - **IT infrastructure** requirements.
    - Support for **third-party software** and **legacy systems**.
    - Availability of **consulting** and **training services**.

## [[Operation and Post-Implementation]]

- **Go-live** is a critical milestone in the project.
- All project teams must focus on completing tasks and resolving issues before **Go-live**.
- The **readiness process** should involve as many team members, users, and managers as possible.

## Five Areas of Stabilization

1. **Training** for end-users.
2. **Reactive support** (e.g., help desk for troubleshooting).
3. **Auditing** to ensure **data quality** is maintained.
4. **Data fixes** to resolve migration errors found during audits.
5. Implementation of **new features** to support evolving organizational needs.
