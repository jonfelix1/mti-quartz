# Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Business Processes

## Business Processes and ERP

- A crucial role of **ERP** in business is to help organizations **adapt** and **change** their **business processes** more effectively.
- A **business process** is a series of tasks or activities grouped to achieve a specific **business function** or **goal** (e.g., **order fulfillment**, **procurement**).
- **ERP software** includes hundreds of **business processes** (best practices) built into the system's logic, which may or may not align with the organization's current processes.


## Business Benefits of an ERP System

- **Information sharing** boosts collaboration between units.
- Real-time **information exchange** with supply-chain partners improves efficiency.
- **Customer service** improves due to faster information flow.
- Greater **organizational agility** to respond to changes and maintain market share.

## Business Limitations of an ERP System

- **Retraining employees** can be costly and time-consuming.
- **Changes in business roles** and department boundaries can cause resistance and upheaval.
