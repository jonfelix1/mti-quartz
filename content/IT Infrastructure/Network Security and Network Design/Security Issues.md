Here’s an elaboration on the topics you provided regarding **Security Issues**:

# Security Issues

## Physical Protection
- **Environmental Damage Prevention**: Organizations must protect their infrastructure from natural disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, and extreme temperatures. This can include:
  - **Site Selection**: Building in locations less prone to natural disasters.
  - **Infrastructure Resilience**: Using materials and designs that can withstand environmental stresses.

- **Physical Security Measures**: These measures include:
  - **Locked Rooms and Equipment**: Ensuring that sensitive areas and devices are secured against unauthorized access.
  - **Cable Management**: Securing keyboards, computers, and other devices to prevent theft or tampering.

- **Electrical Protection**: To mitigate risks from power surges:
  - **Surge Protectors and Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS)**: Installing these devices can protect equipment from voltage spikes and provide backup power during outages.

- **Noise Protection**: This involves:
  - **Strategic Placement**: Locating computers away from devices that produce electromagnetic interference, like motors or microwaves, to reduce potential data corruption or hardware malfunction.

## Surveillance
- **Security Cameras**: Proper placement of surveillance cameras can:
  - **Deter Theft and Vandalism**: The visible presence of cameras can discourage criminal behavior.
  - **Provide Evidence**: Recorded footage can be invaluable in investigating incidents.

- **Intrusion Detection Systems**: Specialists work to:
  - **Prevent Unauthorized Access**: Implementing measures to detect and respond to breaches in real time.
  - **Analyze Breach Attempts**: Understanding attack vectors to strengthen defenses.

- **Honeypots**: This technique involves:
  - **Creating Decoy Systems**: Network personnel design systems that mimic real assets, drawing in malicious actors to observe their tactics and motives.

## Security Policy and Management
### Attackers' Advantage
- **Asymmetry of Attack**: It is typically easier for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities than for defenders to detect and respond to attacks, highlighting the need for robust security practices.
  
- **Achieving Security**: Complete security is unattainable, but:
  - **User Responsibility**: Users should engage in "safe computing" practices, such as:
    - Avoiding downloads from untrusted sources.
    - Not opening suspicious email attachments.
    - Being wary of fraudulent websites and scams.
  
- **Luck vs. Diligence**: Attackers may succeed due to chance, while defenders must rely on thoroughness, following established standards (like COBIT, ISO), and fostering a culture of security awareness and collaboration.

### Security Policy Design Issues
- **Defining Security Levels**: Companies need to determine:
  - Their desired security posture and how much they are willing to invest in protective measures.
  
- **Access Restrictions**: It’s critical to evaluate:
  - Not just Internet access, but all potential entry points to the network and physical facilities.
  
- **Policy Development**: A comprehensive security policy is necessary to:
  - Balance risks against protective measures, ensuring all potential threats are considered.

## Auditing
- **Audit Creation**: Regular audits (both digital and physical) can help:
  - **Detect Malfeasance**: Identifying unauthorized actions and correcting vulnerabilities.
  
- **Deterrence**: Knowing that audits occur can discourage potential wrongdoers from attempting breaches.

- **Transaction Auditing**: Many network operating systems provide tools for:
  - **Monitoring Activity**: Enabling administrators to track and review transactions and changes made within the system.

- **Criminal Accountability**: Numerous cases have shown that thorough auditing can lead to:
  - The apprehension of individuals involved in cybercrime.
