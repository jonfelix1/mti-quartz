# Authentication (ID Check)

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users trying to access the system. Various methods are used, often categorized into three factors:

- **What You KNOW**:
    
    - Typically involves passwords or PINs that only the user should know. However, passwords are vulnerable to various attacks, so their management is crucial.
- **What You HAVE**:
    
    - Involves physical tokens like smart cards or security keys, which provide an additional layer of security.
- **What You ARE**:
    
    - Biometric verification includes fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, or retina scans, providing a unique way to authenticate users based on their physical characteristics.

At least one of these factors must be used to establish a user's identity effectively.
