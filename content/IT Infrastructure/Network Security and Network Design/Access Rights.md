# Access Rights

Understanding access rights involves answering two critical questions:

- **Who**:
    - Determines which users or groups are granted access. Access may be granted to individuals, groups of users, or all users in the organization.
- **How**:
    - Defines what actions the user or group can perform. Access rights might include read, write, delete, print, copy, or execute permissions.

Most modern network operating systems provide robust systems for managing and assigning access rights, ensuring that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access.
