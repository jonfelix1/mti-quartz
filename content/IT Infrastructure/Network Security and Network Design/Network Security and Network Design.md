# Network Security and Network Design

## [[Network Security]]

**MAIN IDEA: PREVENT ILLEGAL ENTRY**

Network security focuses on safeguarding the network's integrity and data against unauthorized access or threats. The primary objective is to prevent illegal entry, which is typically achieved through various methods, including login systems and port security.

- **Complexity of Computers**:
    
    - Computers are intricate, programmable machines. The complexity means that whoever programs them has control, often without the end-user's awareness.
    - This lack of transparency leads to potential flaws in programming, which can be exploited.
    - There are no universally clear definitions of security perimeters, such as doors, walls, windows, or roofs, leading to vulnerabilities.
- **Ubiquity of Networks**:
    
    - Networks are pervasive and facilitate both legitimate and malicious traffic.
    - Every connected device can be a potential entry point for malicious actors.
- **The Bottom Line**:
    
    - Complete computer security is often considered unattainable; it resembles a perpetual cat-and-mouse game between security professionals and cybercriminals, similar to the dynamics between crime and law enforcement.



Network security encompasses the strategies and technologies used to protect networks and their data from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage. Key components include:

- **[[Access Control]]**: Mechanisms to restrict access to network resources based on user permissions.
- **[[Access Rights]]**: Specific permissions defining what users can do within a system.
- **[[Authentication (ID Check)]]**: The process of verifying user identities through various methods like passwords or biometrics.
- **[[Computer Security Issues]]**: Challenges and vulnerabilities that threaten the integrity and confidentiality of computer systems.
- **[[Crypto Techniques]]**: Encryption methods used to secure data during transmission and storage.
- **[[Cyber Threats]]**: Risks that can exploit vulnerabilities, including malware and phishing attacks.
- **[[Goals of Computer Security (CIA+)]]**: The core principles of security, including **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability**, along with other considerations like accountability.
- **[[Hacking Cycle]]**: A structured methodology employed by hackers to infiltrate and exploit systems.
- **[[NIST Recommendations for Setting Up Passwords (2024)]]**: Guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology for creating secure password policies.
- **[[Passwords and ID Systems]]**: Systems for managing user identities and their associated credentials.
- **[[Security Issues]]**: Broader concerns related to the safeguarding of information systems.


## [[Network Design]]
Network design involves planning and implementing a network structure that meets organizational requirements. Essential aspects include:

- **Design Goals**: Objectives such as ensuring service delivery, reliability, scalability, and cost-efficiency.
- **Design Choices**: Considerations regarding distribution, transparency, security, connectivity technology, and environmental impact.
- **Design Approaches**: Methods like traditional analytic design and building block approaches, both utilizing iterative processes.
- **Design Stages**: Key steps including requirement agreement, prioritization, assessment, information gathering, site constraints evaluation, and planning.
- **Connectivity Options**: Technology selections for Local Area Networks (LANs), Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs), and wireless solutions.
- **Capacity Planning**: The process of estimating user response times, application behavior, and overall network utilization to minimize downtime and costs.
