# Goals of Computer Security (CIA+)

Effective network security hinges on several fundamental principles, often referred to as the CIA triad, supplemented with additional considerations:

- **Confidentiality**:
    
    - Ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals. Encryption and access controls are common methods to achieve confidentiality.
- **Integrity**:
    
    - Guarantees that data remains accurate and unaltered during storage and transmission. Measures like hashing and checksums help verify data integrity.
- **Availability**:
    
    - Ensures that data and services are accessible when needed by authorized users. This includes maintaining hardware, implementing redundancy, and planning for disaster recovery.
- **Additional Principles**:
    
    - **Authenticity**: Verifying the identity of users and systems.
    - **Reliability**: Ensuring systems perform consistently and correctly over time.
