# Enigma Technology (1930)

- **Overview**: The Enigma machine was a complex cipher device used by the German military during World War II to encode secret communications. It represented a significant advancement in both usability and cryptographic strength.
- **Mechanism**: The machine utilized rotating electromechanical rotors that altered the mappings of the letters as the keys were pressed, generating a new cipher for each letter based on its position and the rotor settings.
- **Keyspace**: With a possible keyspace of approximately 3×101143 \times 10^{114}3×10114, the Enigma's complexity provided significant security against brute-force attacks. However, flaws in its operational procedures eventually led to its compromise.
- **Historical Significance**: Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park successfully decrypted Enigma-encrypted messages, contributing to the Allied victory in WWII. This effort laid the groundwork for modern computer science and cryptography.
