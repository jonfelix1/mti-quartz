# Passwords and ID Systems

Passwords remain the most common form of authentication but are also the most frequently compromised.

- **Best Practices for Password Security**:
    - Change passwords regularly to mitigate risks.
    - Choose complex passwords of at least 8 characters, using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
    - Avoid sharing passwords or writing them down in easily accessible places.
    - Refrain from using easily guessable passwords based on personal information.
