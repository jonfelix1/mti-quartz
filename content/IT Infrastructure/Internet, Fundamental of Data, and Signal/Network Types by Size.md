# Network Types by Size

## Personal Area Network (PAN)

A **Personal Area Network (PAN)** connects devices over very short distances, typically up to 30 feet (about 10 meters). It includes Bluetooth-enabled devices, infrared connections, and USB cables used for wired PANs. The primary purpose of a PAN is to facilitate communication between personal devices such as smartphones, tablets, headphones, and other peripherals.

### Characteristics:
- **Range:** Up to 30 feet (approximately 10 meters).
- **Devices Connected:** Typically limited to a single person's personal devices.
- **Examples:** Wireless technologies like WiFi and Bluetooth; Wired using USB.

## Local Area Network (LAN)

A **Local Area Network (LAN)** covers a small geographical area, usually within a building or campus. LANs connect multiple computers and other networked devices together to share resources and exchange data efficiently. They often rely on Ethernet technology for connectivity via copper cables or fiber optic cables.

### Characteristics:
- **Geographical Scope:** Limited to buildings or campuses.
- **Connection Methods:** Wired using Ethernet standards like ARCNET, FDDI, Token Ring; Wireless using WLAN protocols.
- **Advantages:** Low cost, quick data transfer rates.

## Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

A **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** spans across larger areas than LANs but smaller than WANsâ€”typically covering cities or towns. MANs serve high-speed connectivity needs by connecting several local area networks (LANs), providing internet services to customers, and facilitating business operations. They utilize advanced networking infrastructure including optical fibers and leased lines.

### Characteristics:
- **Geographical Scope:** Covers entire towns or portions of cities.
- **Speed Requirements:** High-performance routers ensure moderate-to-high data throughput speeds comparable to those found in LAN environments.
  
## Wide Area Network (WAN)

A **Wide Area Network (WAN)** extends over large geographic regions, potentially spanning countries or continents. These networks interconnect multiple local area networks (LANs) or metropolitan area networks (MANs) using public telecommunications links such as phone lines, satellite transmissions, or leased lines. This type of network facilitates global communication and resource sharing across vast distances.

### Characteristics:
- **Geographical Scope:** Extends beyond city limits to cover national or international territories.
- **Infrastructure Used:** Leased lines, IP/MPLS routing protocols, SDH/Sonet technologies for long-distance transmission.
