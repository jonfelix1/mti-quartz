# Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)

- **Wavelength Division Multiplexing** multiplexes multiple **data streams** onto a single **fiber-optic line**.
- **Different wavelength lasers** (called **lambdas**) transmit the multiple signals.
- Each signal can be transmitted at a **different rate** from the others.
- **Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)** combines many (30, 40, 50, or more) signals onto one fiber.
- **Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM)** combines only a few lambdas.
