# Making Connection Efficient

Efficient connections are crucial for optimizing data transmission and resource usage in communication networks. Below are key concepts related to making connections more efficient:

## Multiplexing Techniques

- **[[Multiplexing]]**: A technique that allows multiple signals to share a single communication channel, increasing the efficiency of data transmission. Various multiplexing methods help manage and combine different data streams effectively.

- **[[Frequency Division Multiplexing]] (FDM)**: A multiplexing technique that divides the available bandwidth into distinct frequency bands, each carrying a separate signal. FDM is commonly used in analog communication systems.

- **[[Time Division Multiplexing]] (TDM)**: A method that divides the time on a communication channel into separate time slots, allowing multiple signals to share the channel by transmitting one at a time in rapid succession.

- **[[Statistical Time Division Multiplexing]]**: An advanced form of TDM that allocates time slots dynamically based on the statistical distribution of data traffic, optimizing channel usage and reducing delays.

- **[[Synchronous Time Division Multiplexing]]**: A form of TDM where time slots are assigned to each signal in a fixed pattern, ensuring that each signal has a guaranteed time to transmit data.

- **[[FDM + TDM Combination]]**: A hybrid technique that combines frequency and time division multiplexing to maximize the efficiency of bandwidth utilization and improve overall network performance.

- **[[Code Division Multiplexing]]**: A method that allows multiple signals to be transmitted over the same channel simultaneously by assigning unique codes to each signal, enabling simultaneous transmission without interference.

- **[[Wavelength Division Multiplexing]] (WDM)**: A technique used in optical communication that combines multiple light signals at different wavelengths on a single fiber-optic cable, significantly increasing data transmission capacity.

## Compression Techniques

- **[[Compression]]**: The process of reducing the size of data files to save bandwidth and storage space. Compression can be categorized into two types: lossless and lossy.

- **[[Lossless Compression]]**: A type of compression that reduces file size without losing any data, allowing for the original data to be perfectly reconstructed. This is crucial for applications requiring high fidelity.

- **[[Lossy Audio Compression]]**: A compression method that reduces audio file size by removing some audio data, resulting in a loss of quality that may be imperceptible to the average listener.

- **[[Lossy Image Compression]]**: A technique used to reduce image file sizes by removing some image data, which may result in a degradation of image quality, typically used in formats like JPEG.

- **[[Lossy Video Compression]]**: Similar to audio and image compression, this technique reduces video file sizes by discarding some video data. This is commonly used in streaming and video file formats.

- **[[Run-Length Encoding]]**: A simple form of lossless data compression that replaces consecutive identical data values with a single value and a count, effectively reducing file size.

## Efficiency in Connections

- **[[Multiplexing Example]]**: Real-world scenarios where multiplexing is applied, such as combining multiple telephone calls over a single line or multiple data streams over a single fiber optic cable.

- **[[Differential Encoding]]**: A technique used to encode data based on the difference between successive data points rather than their absolute values, improving transmission efficiency and reducing bandwidth usage.
