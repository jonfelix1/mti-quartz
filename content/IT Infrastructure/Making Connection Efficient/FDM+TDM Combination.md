# FDMA/TDMA Combination

[[Frequency Division Multiplexing]] and [[Time Division Multiplexing]] can be combined to enhance communication efficiency. Here's how this combination works:

- **GSM Systems**: In **GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)**, the system uses a combination of FDMA and TDMA. This allows for efficient use of the available spectrum and increased capacity.

- **Channel Allocation**: 
  - **FDMA** divides the frequency spectrum into distinct channels. Each user is allocated a unique frequency band, which reduces interference from other users.
  - **TDMA** divides each frequency channel into time slots. Each user is assigned a specific time slot within the frequency channel to transmit their data.

- **Burst Traffic**: Traffic is **burst onto the channel** at specific intervals or periods. This means that users transmit data in short bursts rather than continuously, which helps in managing the available bandwidth more effectively.

- **Reduced Interference**: Combining FDMA and TDMA reduces interference because:
  - **Frequency Separation**: FDMA separates users by different frequencies, minimizing interference between them.
  - **Time Slot Separation**: TDMA further reduces interference by allocating specific time slots for each user's data transmission within a frequency channel.

By combining these two techniques, more channels can be used efficiently, and the system can handle a higher number of simultaneous users with less interference.
