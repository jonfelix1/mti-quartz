# Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
- Can also be called **Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)**
- **TDM** shares the signal by dividing available **transmission time** on a medium among users.
- It uses **digital signaling** exclusively.
- There are two basic forms of TDM:
    - **Synchronous Time Division Multiplexing**: Allocates fixed time slots to each user.
    - **Statistical Time Division Multiplexing**: Dynamically allocates time slots based on user demand.
