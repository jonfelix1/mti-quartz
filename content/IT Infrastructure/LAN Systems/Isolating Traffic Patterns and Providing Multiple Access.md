# Isolating Traffic Patterns and Providing Multiple Access

## Primary Goal of a Switch

- The primary purpose of a **switch** is to **isolate traffic patterns** from other traffic or from the remainder of the network. 
- This isolation helps reduce **congestion** and **interference** across the network.

## Switch Backplane

- The switch's **backplane** enables **multiple communication paths** to occur **simultaneously**, improving network efficiency by preventing **collisions**.

## Interconnecting Switched Segments

- Using **routers**, it is possible to **interconnect two switched segments**, effectively creating one larger [[Local Area Network (LAN)]]. 
- This allows **different segments** to communicate while maintaining **traffic isolation**.
