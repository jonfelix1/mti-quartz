# Power over Ethernet (PoE)

## Overview

- **Power over Ethernet (PoE)** is a feature that allows **electrical power** to be delivered over **Ethernet cables** alongside the usual data signals.

## Key Features

- **Remote Device Powering**: Enables powering of **remote devices** that are connected via Ethernet without needing a separate power source.
- **Eliminates Need for Nearby Outlets**: Ideal for situations where there are no **electrical outlets** near the device, simplifying installation and reducing clutter.

## Operation

- **Power Transmission**: Electrical power is transmitted through the same Ethernet cables that carry data, which means both data and power share the same connection.
- **Ethernet NIC**: The **Network Interface Card (NIC)** in the remote device receives both power and data via the Ethernet cable.

## Benefits

- **Convenience**: Reduces the need for additional power supplies and wiring.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for easier installation of devices in locations without nearby power outlets.
- **Cost-Effective**: Simplifies network infrastructure and reduces overall installation costs.
