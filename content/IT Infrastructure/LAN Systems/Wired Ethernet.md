# Wired Ethernet

## Overview

- **Ethernet** is the most common form of **LAN** today.
- The [[Star-Wired Bus]] topology is the most prevalent, though the **bus topology** is not completely obsolete.
- Ethernet comes in various forms based on the **medium used**, **transmission speed**, and **technology**.
- Ethernet can also be used to transmit power using [[Power over Ethernet (PoE)]]
- [[Medium Access Control Protocols]] is used by a workstation get it's data onto the [[Local Area Network (LAN)]] Medium 

## Evolution of Ethernet Speeds

- **CSMA/CD** initially operated at **10 Mbps**.
- **100 Mbps** was introduced later.
- Most **NICs** today are **10/100 Mbps**.
- **1000 Mbps (1 Gbps)** was introduced subsequently.
- **10 Gbps** is now being used in high-end applications.

## Features of 1000 Mbps Ethernet

- **Full-duplex** transmission eliminates **collisions**.
- **Prioritization** of traffic is possible using the **802.1p protocol**.
- **Star or mesh topologies** can be employed, especially for trunk lines.
- **Delay-sensitive traffic** (e.g., voice, video) can be separated from **loss-sensitive traffic**.

## Ethernet Standards Table

| **Standard** | **Speed** | **Duplex** | **Topology** | **Key Features**                               |
|--------------|-----------|------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 10 Mbps      | 10 Mbps   | Half/Full   | Star/Bus     | Legacy networks                              |
| 100 Mbps     | 100 Mbps  | Half/Full   | Star/Bus     | Common NICs today                            |
| 1000 Mbps    | 1 Gbps    | Full        | Star/Mesh    | High-performance, prioritization possible    |
| 10 Gbps      | 10 Gbps   | Full        | Star/Mesh    | High-end applications, advanced traffic management |
