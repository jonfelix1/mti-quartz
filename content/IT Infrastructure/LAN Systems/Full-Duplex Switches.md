## Simultaneous Transmission and Reception

- **Full-duplex switches** allow for the **simultaneous transmission** and **reception** of data between a workstation and the switch.
- This capability helps to **eliminate collisions** on the network.

## Wiring Requirements

- To support a **full-duplex connection**, at least **two pairs of wires** are necessary:
  - **One pair** for the **receive operation**
  - **One pair** for the **transmit operation**
- Most installations today use **four pairs of wires**, making wiring typically not an issue.
