# Virtual LANs

## Overview

- A **Virtual LAN (VLAN)** is a **logical subgroup** within a LAN, created using [[Switch]] and **software** rather than physically moving wiring.
- VLANs allow for the creation of a **"network within a network"**, even if employees and their workstations are dispersed throughout a building.

## IEEE 802.1Q Standard

- The **IEEE 802.1Q** standard facilitates the creation of **virtual LANs** by enabling multiple devices to **intercommunicate** and work together.
- With **802.1Q-compliant switches**, a network administrator can **remotely configure** VLANs, eliminating the need for physical cable management in a wiring closet.
