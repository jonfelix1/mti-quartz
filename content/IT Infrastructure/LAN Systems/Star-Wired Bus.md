# Star-Wired Bus

- **Logical operation**: Functions as a **bus**, but physically resembles a **star**
- **Star design** is based on a **hub**
  - All **workstations** connect to the **hub**
  - [[Twisted Pair Wire]] is commonly used to connect workstations to the hub
- **Original hub behavior**:
  - Takes the **incoming [[Signal]]** and broadcasts it out to all connected links
- **Interconnection**:
  - **Hubs** can be interconnected to extend the network using [[Twisted Pair Wire]] [[Coaxial Cable]], or [[Fiber-Optic Cable]]

### Advantages of Star-Wired Bus

- **Modular connectors** and **twisted pair** improve installation and maintenance compared to the **standard bus**

### Disadvantages of Star-Wired Bus

- **Shared network**:
  - When one station transmits, **everyone hears it**
  - All devices share the same **[[Communication Media]]**, leading to potential **collisions**.
