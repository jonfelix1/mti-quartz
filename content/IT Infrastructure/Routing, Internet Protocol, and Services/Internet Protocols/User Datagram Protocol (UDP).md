# User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- **UDP** is a transport layer protocol that serves as an alternative to TCP, particularly suited for applications that do not require a connection-oriented approach.
- **Connectionless Communication**: Unlike TCP, which establishes a connection before data transfer, UDP sends data without establishing a connection, making it faster and more efficient for certain types of applications.
- **Simpler Header**: The UDP header is much simpler than that of TCP, allowing for quicker processing and lower overhead. This makes UDP ideal for real-time applications such as **video streaming**, **voice over IP (VoIP)**, and **online gaming**.
- **Applications**: Common uses of UDP include **DNS lookups**, **broadcast communications**, and applications where speed is critical and some data loss is acceptable.
