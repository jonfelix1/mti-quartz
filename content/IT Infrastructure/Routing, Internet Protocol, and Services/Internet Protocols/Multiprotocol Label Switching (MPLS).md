# Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)

- **MPLS** is an advanced routing technique that operates below the IP layer, providing a means to direct packets from one node to another based on short labels rather than long network addresses.
- **Efficiency**: By using the **MPLS label**, routers can quickly forward packets without having to perform a detailed lookup for each packet, significantly speeding up the routing process.
- **Label Field**: The **20-bit Label field** is used to identify a specific flow of packets, enabling efficient traffic management and faster data transfer across complex networks.
- **Traffic Engineering**: MPLS allows for better bandwidth utilization and management by directing data traffic along predetermined paths, reducing congestion and improving overall network performance.
