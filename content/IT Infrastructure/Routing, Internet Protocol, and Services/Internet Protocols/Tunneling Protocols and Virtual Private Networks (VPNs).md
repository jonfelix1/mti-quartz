# Tunneling Protocols and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
- The Internet is generally not a secure medium for transmitting sensitive data. To facilitate secure communications, **VPNs** create private, encrypted tunnels over the Internet.
- **How VPNs Work**: A VPN establishes a secure connection by encapsulating the data within a tunneling protocol, encrypting it for confidentiality during transit.
- **Benefits**: This method allows remote users to securely access corporate networks, protecting data from eavesdropping and unauthorized access.
