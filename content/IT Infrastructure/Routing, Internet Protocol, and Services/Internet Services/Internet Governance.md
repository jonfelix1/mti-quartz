# Internet Governance

**Internet Governance** involves the development and application of shared principles, norms, rules, decision-making procedures, and programs that shape the evolution and use of the Internet. It includes the roles of governments, the private sector, and civil society.

## Evolution of Internet Governance

- **Early Days (1960 – 1994)**:
  - DARPA net initiated in the late 1960s.
  - TCP/IP invented in the mid-1970s.
  - IETF established in 1986.
  
- **DNS War (1994 – 1998)**:
  - In 1994, DNS was subcontracted to Network Solutions by NSF.
  - ICANN was established in 1998 to oversee domain name allocation and management.

- **World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) (2003-2005)**:
  - WSIS 2003 failed to resolve Internet governance issues; the Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) was formed.
  - In 2005, WSIS adopted the WGIG report and established the Internet Governance Forum (IGF).

## Infrastructure and Standardizations

- **IP Address Distribution Mechanism**:
  - ICANN (U.S. Non-Profit Organization) assigns IP addresses through IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) under IAB (Internet Architecture Board).

## IP Address Administrators in Indonesia
