# Connection-Oriented vs. Connectionless Applications

- **Network Structure** refers to the **physical** components of a network.
- **Applications** that use the network can be either **connection-oriented** or **connectionless**.

## Connection-Oriented Application

- Requires both sender and receiver to establish a **connection** before data transfer.
- Used in applications such as **large file transfers** and **sensitive transactions** (e.g., banking and business).

## Connectionless Application

- No prior connection is required; data is simply sent.
- Example: **Electronic mail** (email).

## Application Over Networks

- A **connection-oriented application** can operate over both **circuit-switched** or **packet-switched** networks.
- A **connectionless application** can also work on both network types but may be more efficient on a **packet-switched** network.
