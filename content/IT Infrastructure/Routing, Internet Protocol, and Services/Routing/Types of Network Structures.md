# Types of Network Structures

## 1. Circuit-Switched Network

- A sub-network where a **dedicated circuit** is established between sender and receiver.
- All data passes over this dedicated circuit.
- Example: AT&T announced in 2009 the phasing out of their switched networks.

## 2. Packet-Switched Network

- A network where all data messages are transmitted using fixed-sized packages called **packets**.
- More efficient use of a telecommunications line since packets from multiple sources can share the medium.

### Forms of Packet-Switched Networks

- **Datagram**: Each packet is independent and may follow its own path.
- **Virtual Circuit**: Creates a logical path through the subnet, and all packets from one connection follow this path.

## 3. Broadcast Network

- Typically found in **local area networks (LANs)** but occasionally found in **wide area networks (WANs)**.
