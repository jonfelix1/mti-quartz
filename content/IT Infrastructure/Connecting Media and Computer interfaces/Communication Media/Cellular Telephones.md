# Cellular Telephones

- **Wireless telephone service**: Also called **mobile telephone**, **cell phone**, and **PCS (personal communications service)**
- To support multiple users in a metropolitan area, the market is divided into **cells**, each with its own **transmission tower** and set of assignable channels.

## 1st Generation
- **AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone Service)**: First popular cell phone service; used **analog signals** and dynamically assigned channels.
- **D-AMPS (Digital AMPS)**: Applied **digital multiplexing techniques** on top of AMPS analog channels.

## 2nd Generation
- **PCS (Personal Communication Systems)**: Essentially **all-digital cell phone service**.
- PCS phones came in three technologies:
  - **TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)**
  - **CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)**
  - **GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)**

## 2.5 Generation
- **GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)**: Used by AT&T Wireless, Cingular Wireless, and T-Mobile in GSM networks (transmits data at **30 kbps to 40 kbps**).
- **CDMA2000 1xRTT**: Used by Verizon Wireless, Alltel, U.S. Cellular, and Sprint PCS (transmits data at **50 kbps to 75 kbps**).
- **IDEN (Integrated Digital Enhanced Network)**: Used by Nextel (Sprint, ptt phone).

## 3rd Generation
- **UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)**: Also called **Wideband CDMA**; the 3G version of GPRS; not backward compatible with GSM.
- **1XEV (1 x Enhanced Version)**: 3G replacement for 1xRTT, with two forms:
  - **1xEV-DO**: For data only.
  - **1xEV-DV**: For data and voice.

## 4th Generation
- **LTE (Long Term Evolution)**: Theoretical speeds of **100 Mbps** or more; actual download speeds **10-15 Mbps** (e.g., Verizon).
- **WiMax**: Theoretical speeds of **128 Mbps**; actual download speeds **4 Mbps** (e.g., Sprint and Clearwire).
- **HSPA (High Speed Packet Access)**: **14 Mbps** downlink, **5.8 Mbps** uplink; debated as 3.5G or 4G.
- **HSPA+**: Theoretical downlink of **84 Mbps**, uplink of **22 Mbps** (e.g., T-Mobile); debated as 3.5G or 4G.

One of the candidate for 4G is [[WiMax]]

## 5th Generation
- **5G Technology**: Will provide all possible applications using a universal device, interconnecting existing communication infrastructures.
  - **Reconfigurable multimode and cognitive radio-enabled terminals**
  - **Software-defined radio modulation schemes**: Reconfigurable software downloadable from the Internet.
  - **Development focus**: User terminals will access multiple wireless technologies simultaneously and combine different flows.
  - **Core**: **Re-configurable, Multi-Technology Core**, potentially integrating **nanotechnology**, **cloud computing**, **cognitive radio**, and **artificial intelligence** on an **All IP Platform**.

## 4G vs 5G

### **4G LTE**
- **Mobile Broadband**: Provides high-speed internet access for mobile devices.
- **Machine Type Communication**: Supports communication between machines and devices.

### **5G NR (New Radio)**
- **Enhanced Mobile Broadband**: Improved data speeds and capacity for mobile internet.
- **Massive Machine Type Communication**: Handles a large number of devices and sensors communicating simultaneously.
- **Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication**: Ensures very reliable connections with minimal delay, suitable for applications requiring high precision and speed.
