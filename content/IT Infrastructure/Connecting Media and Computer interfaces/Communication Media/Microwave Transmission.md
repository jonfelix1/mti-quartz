# Microwave Transmission
Transmission using microwave part of the [[Electromagnetic Wave Spectrum]]


## Terrestrial Microwave Transmission
- **Land-based, line-of-sight transmission**
- **Approximately 32-48 kilometers** between towers
- **Transmits data** at hundreds of millions of bits per second
- **Signals will not pass through solid objects**
- Popular with **telephone companies** and **business-to-business transmissions**


## Satellite Microwave Transmission

- Similar to **terrestrial microwave** except the signal travels from a **ground station** on Earth to a **satellite** and back to another ground station.
- Can also transmit signals from one satellite to another.
- Satellites can be classified by their **orbital distance**:

  - **LEO (Low-Earth-Orbit)** – **160 to 1,600 kilometers** out
    - Used for **wireless e-mail**, **special mobile telephones**, **pagers**, **spying**, **videoconferencing**

  - **MEO (Middle-Earth-Orbit)** – **1,600 to 36,000 kilometers** out
    - Used for **GPS (global positioning systems)** and **government**

  - **GEO (Geosynchronous-Earth-Orbit)** – **36,000 kilometers** out
    - Always over the same position on Earth (and always over the **equator**)
    - Used for **weather**, **television**, **government operations**

  - **HEO (Highly Elliptical Earth orbit)** – Satellite follows an **elliptical orbit**
    - Used by the **military** for **spying** and by **scientific organizations** for **photographing celestial bodies**
