# Twisted Pair Wire

![[Pasted image 20240905204539.png#invert_B]]

## What is it?

**Twisted pair wires** consist of one or more pairs of single conductor wires twisted around each other to reduce **electromagnetic interference**. 

- **Categories**: Twisted pair wires are classified into **Category 1 through 7**, though Categories 1, 2, and 4 are nearly obsolete.
- **Twisting**: The twisting of the wires helps reduce interference.
- **Shielding**: Additional shielding can further eliminate interference.

## CAT cables
| UTP Category | Typical Use        | Maximum Data Transfer Rate  | Maximum Transmission Range | Advantages                                                                                         | Disadvantages             |

| Category 1   | Telephone wire     | <100 kbps                   | 5–6 kilometers (3–4 miles) | Inexpensive, easy to install and interface                                                         | Security, noise, obsolete |
| Category 2   | T-1, ISDN          | <2 Mbps                     | 5–6 kilometers (3–4 miles) | Same as Category 1                                                                                 | Security, noise, obsolete |
| Category 3   | Telephone circuits | 10 Mbps                     | 100 m (328 ft)             | Same as Category 1, with less noise                                                                | Security, noise           |

| Category 5   | LANs               | 100 Mbps (100 MHz)          | 100 m (328 ft)             | Same as Category 1, with less noise                                                                | Security, noise           |
| Category 5e  | LANs               | 250 Mbps per pair (125 MHz) | 100 m (328 ft)             | Same as Category 5. Also includes specifications for connectors, patch cords, and other components | Security, noise           |
| Category 6   | LANs               | 250 Mbps per pair (250 MHz) | 100 m (328 ft)             | Higher rates than Category 5e, less noise                                                          | Security, noise, cost     |

## Why is it used?
**Twisted pair wire** is the most common form of wiring used in networks due to several factors:

- **Cost-effective** and **easy to install**
- Capable of carrying **high data rates**, though not the highest
- Prone to **electromagnetic noise** and can be **easily wire-tapped**
- Available in both **shielded** and **unshielded** versions for different levels of interference protection
