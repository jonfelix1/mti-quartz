# Fiber-Optic Cable

![[Pasted image 20240905205007.png#invert_B]]


## What is it?

- **Structure**: A thin glass cable (slightly thicker than a human hair) surrounded by a plastic coating, packaged into an insulated cable.
  
- **Function**: 
  - A **photo diode** or **laser** generates pulses of light that travel down the fiber optic cable.
  - These pulses are received by a **photo receptor**.


## Why is it used?
- **Advantages**:
  - **Highest data rate**: Capable of carrying the highest data rates over the longest distances.
  - **Security**: Not affected by electromagnetic noise and cannot be easily wiretapped.
  - **Cost**: While the initial cost is higher than twisted pair cables, it's lower than coaxial, and its superior performance outweighs the cost.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires **two fibers** for a round-trip connection.
  - Still vulnerable to **noise**, despite being immune to electromagnetic interference.
