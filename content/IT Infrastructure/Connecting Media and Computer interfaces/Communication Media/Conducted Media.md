# Conducted Media

## Overview

- **Definition**: Uses physical cables, such as twisted pair, coaxial, or fiber optic, to transmit data.
- **Common Examples**: Twisted pair wires, coaxial cables, and fiber optics.
- **Signal Transmission**: Transmits electrical or light signals through cables.
- **Installation**: Requires physical installation of cables, which can be labor-intensive and expensive.
- **Cost**: Higher initial cost due to the need for cabling infrastructure.
- **Bandwidth**: Provides higher bandwidth with less interference.
- **Security**: More secure as physical access is needed to tap the data.
- **Mobility**: Limited to fixed locations due to the use of cables.
- **Distance**: Range is limited by the length of the physical cables.
