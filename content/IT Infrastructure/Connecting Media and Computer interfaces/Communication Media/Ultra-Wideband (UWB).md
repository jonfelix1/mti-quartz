# Ultra-Wideband (UWB)

- **Broad Frequency Range**: UWB broadcasts over a wide range of frequencies simultaneously, not limited to a fixed bandwidth.
- **Low Power**: Uses very low power levels, minimizing the risk of interference with other sources operating on the same frequencies.
- **Speeds**: Can achieve speeds up to **100 Mbps**, typically for **short distances** such as in wireless LANs.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Proponents' View**:
  - UWB is seen as beneficial for sharing frequencies with other sources without causing significant interference.
  - Claims of "getting something for nothing" due to efficient use of shared frequencies.

- **Opponents' Concerns**:
  - **Cell Phone Industry**: Concerns about UWB's interference with **CDMA** technology, which is sensitive to such interference.
  - **GPS**: Potential for UWB to affect GPS signals.

- **Potential Solutions**:
  - **Dual Systems**: Implementing two types of UWB systems:
    - **Indoor**: Higher power levels.
    - **Outdoor**: Reduced power (about 1/10 of indoor power) to minimize interference.
