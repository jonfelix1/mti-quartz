# ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4 Standard)

- **Low Data Transfer Rates**: Typically **20-250 Kbps**, designed for low power consumption.
- **Ideal Uses**: Suitable for applications such as:
  - **Heating**
  - **Cooling**
  - **Security**
  - **Lighting**
  - **Smoke and CO detector systems**
  
- **Mesh Design**: ZigBee supports a **mesh network** topology, allowing:
  - **Devices** to both **receive** and **forward** ZigBee signals, extending the range and reliability of the network.
