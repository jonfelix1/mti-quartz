# Bluetooth

- **Specification for short-range**, point-to-point or point-to-multipoint **voice and data transfer**.
- Can **transmit through solid, non-metal objects**.
- Typical link range is **10 cm to 10 meters**, but can be extended to **100 meters** by increasing the power.

## Typical Uses
- **Phones**
- **Pagers**
- **Modems**
- **LAN access devices**
- **Headsets**
- **Notebooks**
- **Desktop computers**
- **PDAs**

## Bluetooth Generations

- **Bluetooth 1.0 and 1.1** (1999)
  - **1 Mbps** maximum data rate
  - Initial standard with limited adoption and interoperability issues

- **Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)** (2004)
  - **3 Mbps** maximum data rate
  - Improved data transfer speed and power efficiency

- **Bluetooth 3.0 + HS (High Speed)** (2009)
  - **24 Mbps** maximum data rate
  - Introduced high-speed data transfer over Wi-Fi for large files

- **Bluetooth 4.0** (2010)
  - Introduced **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** for low power consumption
  - Maximum data rate of **1 Mbps**

- **Bluetooth 5.3** (2021)
  - **Improved energy efficiency** and **connection reliability**
  - Enhanced **audio quality** and **device coexistence**

## Bluetooth and the ISM Band

- **ISM Band**: Bluetooth operates within the **Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band**.
- **Frequency Range**: Typically operates in the **2.4 GHz** to **2.4835 GHz** frequency range.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Unlicensed**: The ISM band is unlicensed, meaning devices can operate without needing specific regulatory approvals.
  - **Global Availability**: The 2.4 GHz band is globally available, allowing Bluetooth devices to be used internationally.

### Challenges
  - **Interference**: The 2.4 GHz band is also used by other technologies like Wi-Fi, microwaves, and cordless phones, which can cause **interference**.
  - **Congestion**: High density of devices operating in the same band can lead to **signal congestion** and reduced performance.

### Channelization
  - Bluetooth divides the 2.4 GHz band into **79 channels**, each **1 MHz** wide in Bluetooth Classic, or **40 channels** (2 MHz wide) in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
  - **Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)**: Bluetooth uses FHSS to minimize interference by rapidly switching frequencies during communication.
