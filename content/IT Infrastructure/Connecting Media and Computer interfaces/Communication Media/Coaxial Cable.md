## What is it?

- **Structure**: A single wire wrapped in foam insulation, surrounded by a braided metal shield, and covered with a plastic jacket. It comes in various thicknesses.
    
- **Types**:
    - **Baseband Coaxial Technology**: Utilizes digital signaling, where the cable carries only one channel of digital data.
    - **Broadband Coaxial Technology**: Transmits analog signals and supports multiple channels.


## Why is it used?
- **Advantages**:
    
    - Due to shielding, it can carry a wide bandwidth of frequencies.
    - Suitable for applications like cable television.
- **Disadvantages**:
    
    - More difficult to install compared to twisted pair cables.
    - More expensive than twisted pair cables.
