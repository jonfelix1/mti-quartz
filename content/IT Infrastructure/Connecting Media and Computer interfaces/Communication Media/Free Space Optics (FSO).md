# Free Space Optics (FSO)

- **Uses lasers** or **infrared transmitting devices**.
- Requires **line of sight** between buildings.
- Typically used for **short distances**, such as across a street.
- **Auto-tracking systems** are used to keep lasers aligned despite building movement caused by wind and traffic.

## Performance and Limitations

- **Current Speeds**:
  - Range from **T-3 (45 Mbps)** to **OC-48 (2.5 Gbps)**.
  - Faster systems are in development.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - **Transmission through fog**: Fog significantly impacts signal quality and range.
  - **Link Margin**: A typical FSO system has a link margin of about **20 dB**.
  - **Power Reduction**: Under ideal conditions, air reduces a systemâ€™s power by approximately **1 dB/km**.
  - **Scintillation**: Signal distortion due to atmospheric conditions, especially in hot weather.
