    - **ATA2**: Includes **PIO (Programmed Input/Output)**, **DMA (Direct Memory Access)**, and **LBA (Logical Block Addressing)**
    - **ATA3**: Supports **Ultra DMA** speeds of **33/66/100/133 Mbps**
- **ATAPI (ATA Packet Interface)**:
    - Used for **CD-ROMs**, **tape drives**, and other devices
- **Connection**:
    - **40-pin ribbon cable**
    - **Master-Slave** configuration (only one device can be active at a time)

**Use Cases**:

- **Legacy Systems**: Often used in older computer systems and some embedded applications.
- **Affordable Storage**: Cost-effective solution for basic storage needs in older systems.

## SATA (Serial ATA)

- **Versions**:
    - **SATA-1**: **1.5 Gbit/s**
    - **SATA-2**: **3 Gbit/s**
    - **SATA-3**: **6 Gbit/s**
- **Connection**: Serial interface with **smaller cables** than ATA.

**Use Cases**:

- **Modern Desktops and Laptops**: Commonly used in contemporary PCs for connecting hard drives and SSDs.
- **High-Speed Storage**: Provides higher data transfer rates for faster read/write operations.
- **Consumer Electronics**: Used in devices requiring high-speed data storage and retrieval, such as gaming consoles and media servers.](<ATA (AT Attachment)
