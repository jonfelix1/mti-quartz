# Peripherals

**Peripherals** refer to any external devices that can be connected to a computer, enhancing its functionality. These devices are generally **slower** than the CPU and may hold up processing when waiting for input or output operations. For instance, when playing a game, loading the next level from a **CD** may delay the CPU's tasks as it waits for data to be written to **memory**.

## Examples of Peripherals

- **Input/Output (I/O):**
  - **Hard Disk**
  - **CD/DVD (RW)**
  - **SSD (Solid-State Drive)**
  - **Flash Disk**
  - **Memory Card**

- **Input Devices:**
  - **Keyboard**
  - **Mouse**
  - **Scanner**

- **Output Devices:**
  - **CRT Monitors**
  - **Projectors**
  - **Printers**

These devices are essential for interacting with the computer system and performing various operations like data storage, retrieval, and display.
