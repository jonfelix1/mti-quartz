# Interface Standards

## Types of Standards:
1. **Official Standards**:
   - Created by recognized organizations like:
     - **ITU** (International Telecommunications Union)
     - **IEEE** (Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
     - **EIA** (Electronic Industries Association)
     - **ISO** (International Organization for Standardization)
     - **ANSI** (American National Standards Institute)

2. **De Facto Standards**:
   - Not created by official organizations but gain widespread acceptance due to popular use, eventually becoming "almost" standards.

## Components
1. **Electrical Component**:
   - Deals with **voltages**, **line capacitance**, and other **electrical characteristics**.

2. **Mechanical Component**:
   - Describes **connectors** or **plugs** and their physical structure.

3. **Functional Component**:
   - Describes the **function of each pin** or **circuit** within the interface.

4. **Procedural Component**:
   - Defines how **circuits are used** to carry out operations.

## Example Interface Standards:
- [[EIA-232F]]
- [[USB (Universal Serial Bus)]]
- [[ATA & SATA]]
- [[Fibre Channel]]
- [[FireWire]]
- [[InfiniBand]]
- [[SCSI and iSCSI]]


## Future
[[Interface Trends]]: Interface Standard is always evolving.
