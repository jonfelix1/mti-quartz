# Synchronous Connections

**Synchronous connections** transfer data in large frames, making them more efficient for transferring large amounts of data compared to asynchronous connections.

- **Frame**: A synchronous frame includes:
  - **Header** and **trailer flags**
  - **Control information**
  - **Address information** (optional)
  - **Error detection code**
  - **Data** (payload)

Synchronous communication is more complex but allows **faster data transfer** due to reduced overhead.
