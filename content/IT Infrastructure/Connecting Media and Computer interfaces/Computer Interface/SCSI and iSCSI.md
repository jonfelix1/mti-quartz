#  SCSI and iSCSI

## SCSI (Small Computer System Interface)

- **Purpose**: A technique for interfacing a computer to **high-speed devices** such as **hard disk drives**, **tape drives**, **CDs**, and **DVDs**
- **Design**: Supports devices of a more **permanent nature**
- **Type**: A **systems interface**
- **Requirements**: Requires a **SCSI adapter**

**Use Cases**:

- **Enterprise Storage**: Used in environments requiring high-speed data transfer and reliability, such as data centers and server rooms.
- **High-Performance Computing**: Suitable for applications needing fast access to storage devices.

## iSCSI (Internet SCSI)

- **Purpose**: A technique for interfacing **disk storage** to a computer via the **Internet**
- **Design**: Extends SCSI functionality over **IP networks**

**Use Cases**:

- **Storage Area Networks (SANs)**: Utilized in SANs for remote storage access over existing network infrastructure.
- **Cost-Effective Storage Solutions**: Provides a way to use existing network infrastructure for storage access, reducing costs.
