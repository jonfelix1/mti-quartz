- **USB 3.0**: Supports up to **4.8 Gbps**.

## Components:
1. **Electrical Component**:
   - Defines two wires: **VBUS** (Power) and **Ground** (5V signal).
   - **D+** and **D-** wires handle **data and signaling**.

2. **Mechanical Component**:
   - Defines four different connector types using only **four wires**.

3. **Functional & Procedural Components**:
   - More **complex**; based on a **polled bus system** where the computer checks each peripheral to see if it has data to send.
