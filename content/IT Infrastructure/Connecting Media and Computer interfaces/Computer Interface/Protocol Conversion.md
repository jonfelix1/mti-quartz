# Protocol Conversion

A **protocol** is a set of rules and standards that governs the **connection**, **communication**, and **data transfer** between devices. Different devices or systems may use different protocols, so **protocol conversion** is necessary to ensure proper communication.

- **Protocol Conversion**: 
  - Ensures that the **communication protocols** used by a peripheral are compatible and can be understood by the computer, and vice versa.
  - It allows devices with **different communication standards** to work together, ensuring smooth data transmission.

### Handling of Status Signals

**Status signals** provide feedback about the operational state of a peripheral device, such as whether it is ready to send or receive data. These signals are important for:

- Informing the user or system if there is a **problem** (e.g., printer out of paper).
- Ensuring that the computer does not attempt to communicate with a **non-ready** device.
- This information helps the **interface** manage device communication efficiently and notify the user if an issue arises. 

### Key Functions:
- **Protocol Conversion**: Makes sure different devices communicate properly.
- **Status Signals**: Indicate if a device is ready or if thereâ€™s an issue requiring user intervention.
