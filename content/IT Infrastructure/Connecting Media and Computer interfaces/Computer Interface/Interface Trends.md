# Interface Trends

- **Development Focus**:
    - **Increasing Speed**: Enhancing how quickly interfaces allow **peripherals** and **computers** to communicate.
    - **Wireless Communication**: Facilitating **wireless communication** between peripheral devices and the **CPU**.
- **I/O Consolidation Competition**:
    - **iSCSI**
    - **Fibre Channel**
    - **InfiniBand**

## Why I/O Consolidation?

- **Factors Driving Consolidation**:
    
    - **More Powerful CPUs**: **Multicore** and **multisocket** architectures
    - **Server Virtualization**: Efficient management of virtual environments
    - **High Demand for I/O Bandwidth**: Increasing need for data transfer capacity
    - **Reduction in Cables and Power**: Minimizing physical connections and power consumption
    - **Limited Number of Interfaces**: Need to optimize and consolidate available interfaces
- **Current Competition**:
    - [[SCSI and iSCSI]]
    - [[Fibre Channel]]
    - [[InfiniBand]]
    
[[SCSI and iSCSI]]and [[Fibre Channel]] are favored due to the **popularity of Ethernet**.
