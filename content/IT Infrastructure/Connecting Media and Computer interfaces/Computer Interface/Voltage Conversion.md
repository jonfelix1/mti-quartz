# Voltage Conversion in Interfaces

**Peripherals** often operate at **different voltages** than the **processor** and the components on a computer's **motherboard**. To ensure proper communication and prevent damage to the system, an **interface** is needed to handle **voltage conversion**.

## Key Points:
- **Peripherals** and **processors** may use different voltage levels for data transmission.
- The **interface** adjusts these voltage levels to ensure compatibility between the computer and the peripheral.
- **Voltage conversion** protects both the computer and the peripheral from potential damage due to mismatched voltages, enabling smooth data transfer.

This voltage adjustment is a critical function of an interface, ensuring that peripherals can communicate efficiently with the CPU and other components.
