# Digital to Analog and Analog to Digital Converters

When a computer is connected to a **peripheral** device, an **interface** is required to facilitate communication between them. Many peripherals rely on **analog signals**, while computers process data digitally, so there is a need to **convert** signals between these two forms.

- **DAC (Digital to Analog Converter)**:
  - Converts **digital signals** from the computer into **analog signals** that the peripheral device can understand.
  - Example: Converting digital audio signals into analog sound for speakers.

- **ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)**:
  - Converts **analog signals** from the peripheral into **digital signals** that the computer can process.
  - Example: Converting an analog microphone input into digital audio data for the computer.

## Key Roles:
- **DAC**: Digital → Analog (e.g., for speakers, monitors)
- **ADC**: Analog → Digital (e.g., for microphones, sensors)

These converters ensure smooth communication between the **CPU** and devices that operate with different signal formats.
