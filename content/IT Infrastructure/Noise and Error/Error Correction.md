# Error Correction

**Correcting errors** with no further help from the transmitter involves using redundant information that allows the receiver to identify and correct errors independently.

- **Forward Error Correction (FEC)**: This method requires a significant amount of redundant information to be transmitted along with the original data.
- **Purpose**: The redundant information enables the receiver to detect and correct errors without needing to request retransmission.
- **Codes Used**: Commonly involves codes such as [[Hamming Code]].
