# Cyclic Redundancy Checksum (CRC)

**Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)** is an error detection method that uses polynomial arithmetic to check data integrity. Here's a summary of how CRC works and an example calculation.

## CRC Process

1. **Representation**: Treat the data packet as a polynomial.
2. **Division**: Divide this polynomial by a generating polynomial using polynomial arithmetic.
3. **Remainder**: Append the remainder of this division to the end of the message.
4. **Verification**: The receiver performs the same division with the appended message. If the remainder is zero, the message is error-free.

## Example Calculation with Polynomial $( x^3 + x + 1 )$

### Step-by-Step Example

**Data Polynomial**: $(1101)$ (binary representation, which corresponds to $( x^3 + x^2 + x^0 )$)

**Generator Polynomial**: $( x^3 + x + 1 )$ (binary representation $(1011)$)

1. **Append Zeros**: Append 3 zeros to the data polynomial, where 3 is the degree of the generator polynomial.

   - **Extended Data Polynomial**: $(1101)$ becomes $(1101000)$

2. **Division**: Perform polynomial division of $(1101000)$ by $(1011)$.

   - **Binary Division**:

     ```
     1101000 รท 1011
     ```

   - **Perform Division**:

     ```
       1011 | 1101000
             1011
             ----
             01100
              1011
             ----
              0101
               1011
             ----
                0100
     ```

   - **Remainder**: The result of the division is $(100)$.

3. **Append Remainder**: The remainder $(100)$ is appended to the original data polynomial.

   - **Message with CRC**: $(1101000)$ with remainder $(100)$ gives $(110100100)$

4. **Verification**: The receiver performs the same division with the appended message $(110100100)$ and checks if the remainder is zero.

   - If the remainder is zero, the data is correct. Otherwise, there was an error during transmission.

- **CRC**: Utilizes polynomial arithmetic for error detection.
- **Process**: Involves polynomial division and appending the remainder.
- **Example**: For data $(1101)$ and generator polynomial $( x^3 + x + 1 )$, the remainder after division is $(100)$.
