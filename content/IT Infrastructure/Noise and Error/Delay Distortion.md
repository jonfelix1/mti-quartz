# Delay Distortion

**Delay Distortion** occurs when the propagation speed of a signal varies with its frequency as it travels through a medium.

## Characteristics

- **Definition**: Delay distortion arises because different frequencies of a signal travel at different speeds, leading to distortion of the signal waveform.
- **Impact**: Can cause the signal to become misaligned or spread out, affecting data integrity and communication quality.

## Management

- **Equalization**: Using equalizers to adjust the signal and compensate for frequency-dependent delays can help reduce delay distortion.
- **Signal Processing**: Implementing advanced signal processing techniques to minimize the effects of delay distortion and restore signal quality.
