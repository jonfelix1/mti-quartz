# Attenuation

**Attenuation** refers to the gradual loss of signal strength as it travels through a medium.

## Characteristics

- **Definition**: Attenuation is the reduction in signal amplitude or strength that occurs over distance due to the inherent properties of the transmission medium.
- **Impact**: Results in a weaker signal at the receiver end, which can reduce signal quality and increase the likelihood of errors.

## Management

- **Amplification**: Using amplifiers to boost the signal strength at intervals can counteract attenuation and maintain signal integrity over long distances.
- **Signal Boosting**: Implementing signal repeaters or boosters to amplify the signal and reduce loss during transmission.
